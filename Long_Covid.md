[Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00324-2/fulltext) | Hampshire, A., Trender, W., Chamberlain, S.R., Jolly, A.E., Grant, J.E., Patrick, F., Mazibuko, N., Williams, S.C., Barnby, J.M., Hellyer, P. and Mehta, M.A., 2021. Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19. _EClinicalMedicine_, p.101044. | This paper describes an interesting and concerning phenomenon (although no mechanistic explanation is proposed here). In patients who have recovered from COVID, cognitive deficits seem to remain, even if they didn't experience a lot of symptoms (although those who experienced severe symptoms and were on ventilators were the most affected). "The scale of the observed deficit was not insubstantial; the 0.47 SD global composite score reduction for the hospitalized with ventilator sub-group was greater than the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset. It was larger than the mean deficit of 480 people who indicated they had previously suffered a stroke (−0.24SDs) and the 998 who reported learning disabilities (−0.38SDs). For comparison, in a classic intelligence test, 0.47 SDs equates to a 7-point difference in IQ."

Pathophysiological mechanisms and neurological manifestations in COVID-19. _Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine: Peer-reviewed, Official Publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine_, _24_(10), p.975. | "Hypoxia, immune-mediated injury, and vascular damage are the potential mechanisms for the CNS manifestations. Headache, dizziness, chemosensory disturbances, such as loss of smell, taste, encephalopathy, stroke, etc., are among the commonly encountered neurological presentations."
[Review Article: Complications and Pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the Nervous System](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2020.573421/full) | Yu, H., Sun, T. and Feng, J., 2020. Complications and Pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the Nervous System. _Frontiers in neurology_, _11_, p.1579. | Summarises possible mechanisms by which COVID-19 affects both Central Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System. Mechanisms by which the virus can invade the nervous system include: hypoxic injury, direct invasion, ACE2, coagulopathy, inflammatory response, immune dysfunction. Overall it appears that if COVID-19 makes its way into the nervous system, the long COVID that presents can be quite a complex disease with various mechanisms involved.

Lifting the mask on neurological manifestations of COVID-19. _Nature Reviews Neurology_, _16_(11), pp.636-644. | Comprehensive review in *Nature Reviews Neurology*. "In this article, we review the literature on the association between COVID-19 and neurological manifestations, present evidence from preclinical research suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for many of these manifestations, and summarize the biological pathways that could underlie each neurological symptom."
[Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients](https://f1000research.com/articles/10-550) | Brogna, C., Cristoni, S., Petrillo, M., Querci, M., Piazza, O. and Van den Eede, G., 2021. Toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients. _F1000Research_, _10_(550), p.550. | "Toxin-like peptides, almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals, like conotoxins, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, zinc metal proteinases, and bradykinins, were identified in samples from COVID-19 patients, but not in control samples. (...) The presence of toxin-like peptides could potentially be connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their presence suggests a possible association between COVID-19 disease and the release in the body of (oligo-)peptides almost identical to toxic components of venoms from animals. Their involvement in a large set of heterogeneous extra-pulmonary COVID-19 clinical manifestations, like neurological ones, cannot be excluded."
[The Symptoms and Clinical Manifestations Observed in COVID-19 Patients/Long COVID-19 Symptoms that Parallel _Toxoplasma gondii_ Infections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8163588/) | Roe, K., 2021. The Symptoms and Clinical Manifestations Observed in COVID-19 Patients/Long COVID-19 Symptoms that Parallel Toxoplasma gondii Infections. _Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology_, pp.1-4. | "In a follow-up study of 130 recovered non-critical COVID-19 patients at the same hospital, over 22% of the patients on day 60 after symptom onset reported the unusual symptoms of anosmia (impaired smell) and ageusia (impaired taste), and over 7% still reported the symptoms of dyspnoea (shortness of breath) (Carvalho-Schneider et al. (2020). Over 33% of these recovered COVID-19 patients reported that they felt as bad on day 60 after symptom onset as they felt during their acute disease phase (Carvalho-Schneider et al. 2020). One explanatory hypothesis would be that for some individuals these peculiar symptoms and subpopulation mortality rates are the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections working in bidirectional synergy with one or more existing latent pathogen infections, by means of induced mutually beneficial immune cell dysfunctions, including T cell exhaustion (Zheng et al. 2020a, b; Varikuti et al. 2018; Xiao et al. 2018). Based on medical observations, the most plausible participating latent pathogen infection is the wide-spread protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (Varikuti et al. 2018; Xiao et al. 2018)."

[Immune-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Severity and Chronicity Decoded Using Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.700782/full) | Patterson, B.K., Guevara-Coto, J., Yogendra, R., Francisco, E.B., Long, E., Pise, A., Rodrigues, H., Parikh, P., Mora, J. and Mora-Rodríguez, R.A., 2021. Immune-based prediction of COVID-19 severity and chronicity decoded using machine learning. _Frontiers in immunology_, _12_, p.2520. (Published 28 June 2021). | Dr Bruce K. Patterson, MD, is the current CEO of IncellDx, and was previously an Associate Professor at the Stanford School of Medicine. IncellDx is one of the only companies at the moment which is tackling the problem of long covid diagnosis. Their comprehensive panel measures levels of particular cytokines/inflammatory factors from a patient's blood. The panel is based off validated bioinformatics research that used machine learning to identify the cytokines/factors that distinguish severe covid from long covid and healthy patients.<br><br>This paper describes the bioinformatics approach. The authors use a machine learning algorithm to analyse the immunological landscape of COVID patients through their cytokine levels (14 distinct cytokines from each patient were measured using multiplex cytokine quantification). Using a random forest classifier, the authors construct a model that can distinguish long COVID patients (defined as those with symptoms >12 months post-infection) from severe and mild cases of COVID. Long COVID appears to have a distinct immunological signature, involving increased IFN-γ and IL-2 and a reduced CCL4 production. <br><br>In an [interview on Dr Been's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwjJs5ZHKJI), Dr Patterson shows preliminary results starting at 21 mins indicating that some individuals who have long-lasting effects induced by the COVID vaccine have "long hauler scores" (assigned by his machine learning algorithm based on the levels of 14 cytokines/chemokines) which are similar to those of individuals with long covid. This is strong evidence that COVID vaccines using the spike protein as its antigen (currently, all COVID vaccines on market) can cause long covid in individuals that appears indistinguishable from individuals with long covid caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[Persistence of SARS CoV-2 S1 Protein in CD16+ Monocytes in Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) Up to 15 Months Post-Infection](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v3.full) | Patterson, B.K., Francisco, E.B., Yogendra, R., Long, E., Pise, A., Rodrigues, H., Hall, E., Herrara, M., Parikh, P., Guevara-Coto, J. and Triche, T.J., 2021. Persistence of SARS CoV-2 S1 protein in CD16+ monocytes in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) up to 15 months post-infection. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 26 July 2021). |  From the Patterson MD team, this paper describes a possible mechanism of long covid that is mediated by non-classical monocytes that present spike protein on their surface up to 15 months post-infection.<br><br>The presentation of spike protein was confirmed through three independent methods: flow cytometry, mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and whole genome viral sequencing. The whole genome viral sequencing confirmed that spike protein was NOT due to persistent SARS-CoV-2 virus replication: "Full length sequencing of the five cases submitted for genomic analysis failed to identify any full-length sequence in the spike protein gene, or any other gene, that could account for the observed spike protein detected by proteomic analysis. In contrast, fragmented SARS-CoV-2 sequence was identified in all five of the cases."<br><br>This suggests that the reason why spike protein is still present in long covid, is due to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or phagocytosis of infected cells undergoing apoptosis:<br> "It is unlikely these patients are producing any replication competent viral genomes, and are thus incapable of transmitting the infection. In contrast, the patients reported here appear to have developed an immune response to retained viral antigens, specifically the S1 fragment of the spike protein, which continues to be presented by CD16+ monocytes, eliciting an innate immune response characterized by elevated inflammatory markers including interferon **_γ_**, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-2, among others. The body of evidence reported here would not support continued viral replication. Instead, it implicates dysregulation of innate immunity inflammatory mediators in response to persistent viral protein presentation by CD16+ monocytes."<br><br>Non-classical monocytes (also referred to as CD16+ monocytes) are a more mature (dfferentiated) state of classical monocytes, which make up the majority (85%) of circulating monocytes in humans. In the Discussion, the authors highlight how "Classical monocytes have a circulating lifespan of approximately one day before they either migrate into tissues, die, or turn into intermediate and subsequently nonclassical monocytes". Unfortunately, this process goes haywire in individuals with severe or long covid, as these non-classical monocytes acquire hallmarks of cellular senescence. The authors propose the following mechanism:<br><br>"It has been shown in both humans and mice that nonclassical monocytes require fractalkine (CX3CL1) and TNF to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival (_[22](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v3.full#ref-22)_). Our previous data show high IFN-γ levels in PASC individuals (_[5](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v3.full#ref-5)_), which can induce TNF-α production (_[23](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.25.449905v3.full#ref-23)_). Further, TNF-α and IFN-γ induce CX3CL1/Fractalkine production by vascular endothelial cells24 creating the conditions to promote survival of nonclassical monocytes."<br><br>In an [interview on Dr Been's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwjJs5ZHKJI), Dr Patterson shows preliminary results starting at 21 mins indicating that some individuals who have long-lasting effects induced by the COVID vaccine have "long hauler scores" (assigned by his machine learning algorithm based on the levels of 14 cytokines/chemokines) which are similar to those of individuals with long covid. This is strong evidence that COVID vaccines using the spike protein as its antigen (currently, all COVID vaccines on market) can cause long covid in individuals through the spike-protein-mediated mechanism described in this paper.

[Pandemrix vaccine: why was the public not told of early warning signs?](https://twin.sci-hub.se/7124/c7df44dce5142b438f6d84a8533e0938/doshi2018.pdf) | This article is about the Pandemrix vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline to address the H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic in 2009. I encourage everyone to read this article with an open mind, and critically reflect upon the parallels with the current situation with COVID-19. Some key points: (1) Due to rushed development, the Pandemrix vaccine had long term effects on health such as narcolepsy which only become evident a year later. (2) Academic studies judged that the vaccines likely caused these long term effects - however,  GSK and the European Medicines Agency, which licensed Pandemrix, have not established a causal relationship, even now, 8 years after the pandemic (!!!); (3) In the end, it wasn't governments/health authorities/pharmaceutical industry that paid the price for the adverse effects, it was the individuals themselves, who have had to go through a lawsuit to obtain compensation. "Now, eight years after the outbreak, new information is emerging from one of the lawsuits that, months before the narcolepsy cases were reported, the manufacturer and public health officials were aware of other serious adverse events logged in relation to Pandemrix." (4) The Irish government still encouraged people to get vaccinated despite that "it was quite clear that the pandemic was on the wane and it was nowhere near the catastrophe portrayed by influenza researchers, governments, industry, and the media."
[The 3-Step COVID Propaganda Detox Plan](https://www.coronababble.com/post/the-3-step-covid-propaganda-detox-plan) | Ingenious concept for an article, written by a former NHS consultant and clinical psychologist, Dr. Gary Sidley. In this article, Sidley brings attention to how the mainstream narrative does not accurately portray the complex reality of the COVID-19 situation, and highlights how fear and manipulation by the media/government has been used to create a narrative that does not fully reflect reality. 
[How the MEAN psychologists got us to comply with coronavirus restrictions](https://www.coronababble.com/post/how-the-mean-psychologists-induced-us-to-comply-with-coronavirus-restrictions) | By the same author as the article above, this article goes into detail of the covert psychological manipulation by government-employed psychologists, in "nudging" the UK public towards a hysteria in regards to the COVID-19 situation. Many examples are described. “The three ‘nudges’ to have evoked the most controversy, among both psychological practitioners and the general public, are: the strategic use of fear (inflating perceived threat levels); shame (conflating compliance with virtue); and peer pressure (portraying non-compliers as a deviant minority) – or ‘affect’, ‘ego’ and ‘norms’, to use the language of behavioural science”. Overall, I found the strategies being used to be similar to those described in *Thinking Fast and Slow*, taking advantage of our subconscious and making us feel like our thoughts/behaviours are of our own control, while they are subtly being influenced. This article has also been covered in a more recent commentary by [The Daily Sceptic](https://dailysceptic.org/the-dubious-ethics-of-nudging-the-public-to-comply-with-covid-restrictions/). I think this article (and the one above) are particularly important as they have the power to make people more aware of how they are subconsciously being manipulated by the government and media. 
[The Noble Lies of COVID-19](https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/noble-lies-covid-fauci-cdc-masks.html) | This *Slate* article examines the ways in which Dr Anthony Fauci has lied to the public, including masks and herd immunity - to influence the public to act in ways that are “better for the greater good”. A very important question that this article raises is - is it better to be transparent with the public so they can make their own decisions, or do they need to be controlled for the greater good of society? 
[Healthy People Do Not Require Genetic Vaccination](https://cassandravoices.com/science-environment/science/healthy-people-do-not-require-genetic-vaccination/) | This is an easy to read and well-written article from a qualified microbiologist and MD, Dr Marcus De Brun, who explains the difference between these novel-technology genetic vaccines (which require the body to act as a "manufacturing line" where there is potential for error at each step) and traditional vaccines. De Brun brings attention to nuance such as possible interactions with mRNA from adenovirus vector with genomic DNA, and other inherent risks of mRNA/DNA vaccines that are not immediately obvious from the mainstream narrative, while referencing past research that was done prior to all the current censorship of information about the risks of DNA/RNA vaccines. 
[VIDEO - Confusion: Keeping up with shifting lockdown and vaccine narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68B1gtPnGlA&t=2s) | This is a YouTube video by Dr. Chris Martenson, who has a PhD in toxicology, numerous years of experience working in biotech, and is now hosting a podcast called *Peak Prosperity*. This video addresses a very important aspect of the whole pandemic situation involving communication between health authorities and the public, and how the shifting narratives and failure of the health authorities to actually follow the science, is leading to a loss in trust in these health authorities. Australia is used as a case study in one part of the video, and he brings attention to the fearmongering in the Australian media and contrasts this to the actual statistics, showing how the response by authorities has been overblown out of proportion. What I really like about this video, is that Martenson has a very balanced and evidence-based viewpoint. He also brings up the importance of considering COVID-19 as a disease that is stratified by age and comorbidities, and that given this information, any individual should be able to do their own risk assessment to determine whether the vaccine is worth it for them. 
[The Masked Ball of Cowardice: How fear of admitting error in trusting China’s coronavirus propaganda is driving Western societies into a doom spiral](https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/masked-ball-cowardice) | A well-written and thought-provoking article that brings attention to a very important part of this whole pandemic - the role and influence of China in the early responses of many countries across the world. The article presents and discusses evidence of how early manipulation of the narrative has caused the truth to be misrepresented and suppressed, and now it is "too late" for governments/health authorities/politicians to go back without making them look bad - so they double down on things like lockdowns, mandates, and other authoritative measures. “The truth is that the origin of lockdown “science” cannot be factually discussed without the Chinese government looking very bad—something media investors are reluctant to allow. It’s even harder to explain phenomena like the fake videos of residents dropping dead during Wuhan’s lockdown, which went viral all over global websites blocked in China, without implying some degree of foul play by the CCP. So instead, overcompensating for Beijing, media outlets portrayed China as not only a responsible international stakeholder, but an admirable one whose example should be followed.”
[Majority of Physicians Decline COVID Shots, according to Survey](https://aapsonline.org/majority-of-physicians-decline-covid-shots-according-to-survey/) | This is a survey of 700 physicians based in the US. The results of the survey indicate that the majority (58%) of physicians have chosen not to be vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The AAPS survey also showed that 54 percent of physician respondents were aware of patients suffering a “significant adverse reaction.” Of the unvaccinated physicians, [80 percent said “I believe risk of shots exceeds risk of disease](https://aaps.wufoo.com/reports/z7ek1br193t0zj/),” and 30% said “I already had COVID.” The results from this survey contrast with the [claim by the American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-survey-shows-over-96-doctors-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19?&utm_source=BulletinHealthCare&utm_medium=email&utm_term=061421&utm_content=NON-MEMBER&utm_campaign=article_alert-morning_rounds_daily&utm_uid=2256120&utm_effort=MRNRD0) that 96 percent of practicing physicians are fully vaccinated. This was [based on 300 respondents](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2021-06/physician-vaccination-study-topline-report.pdf?&utm_source=BulletinHealthCare&utm_medium=email&utm_term=061421&utm_content=NON-MEMBER&utm_campaign=article_alert-morning_rounds_daily&utm_uid=2256120&utm_effort=MRNRD0).
[Some guidance to separating the wheat from the chaff](https://www.geertvandenbossche.org/post/some-guidance-to-separating-the-wheat-from-the-chaff#viewer-524j8) | Dr Geert Vanden Bossche on how to critically evaluate sources of information regarding the COVID-19 situation, and maintain a balanced, open minded and evidence driven perspective.
[Consensus Science and the Peer Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2719747/) | This article is a commentary on the process of peer review, particularly the concept of "consensus science", and how relying on the "consensus" is not actually science. The article mentions how it is common for peer reviewers to say "it does not fit with the consensus", but how this is actually NOT how science works, as this "is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled". Instead, science "...requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What are relevant are reproducible results." I think the message of this article is very relevant to what we are seeing now with the COVID-19 pandemic messaging. We are fed a "consensus" of information from health authorities. Regardless of whether this "consensus" is likely to be true or not, the censorship of evidence to the contrary does not send a good message, and is not good science. 
[COVID-19 and the Political Economy of Mass Hysteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7913136/) | This is a must-read, insightful article about the idea of a "mass hysteria" driving panic, stress, and nocebo effects within the COVID-19 pandemic. What I really like about this article, is that it addresses the psychological effects in detail (including ideas like how the response to COVID-19 by government/health authorities has created a culture of fear, groupthink; the idea that COVID-19 is a social contagion as much as a biological one), independently of any health effects of the pandemic. "In a mass hysteria, people of a group start to believe that they might be exposed to something dangerous, such as a virus or a poison. They believe a threat to be real because someone says so, or because it fits their experience. Due to the threatening delusion, a large group of people gets collectively very upset. In other words, a threat, whether real or imaginary [17], causes collective anxiety [18]. The group members may even start to feel sick. Group members might also get symptoms of sickness including weakness, headaches, or a choking feeling, which are propagated to other persons. When a mass hysteria causes physical symptoms, it is called mass psychogenic illness or epidemic hysteria. The symptoms are caused by the stress and anxiety people experience due to the perceived threat [19]. Mass hysteria is infectious [20] and may be a contributing and amplifying factor in real epidemics."

### SARS-CoV-2 Vaccinations

#### General Concerns
Title | Reference | Notes
--- | --- | ----------
[Vaccine- and natural infection-induced mechanisms that could modulate vaccine safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248#bib0640) | Kostoff, R.N., Kanduc, D., Porter, A.L., Shoenfeld, Y., Calina, D., Briggs, M.B., Spandidos, D.A. and Tsatsakis, A., 2020. Vaccine-and natural infection-induced mechanisms that could modulate vaccine safety. _Toxicology Reports_. | A must-read. Comprehensive paper that goes through potential mid- and long-term issues from the rushed development of the vaccines, including ADE, Vaccine-associated Virus Interference, Immune Evasion etc. 16 different concerns/risks are mentioned. Since this article was published, there has already been evidence that ADE may be occurring. It will be interesting to refer back to this to see what other risks/concerns brought up may start to appear. 
[SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are not free of neurological side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206845/) | Finsterer, J. and Scorza, F.A., 2021. SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are not free of neurological side effects. _Acta Neurologica Scandinavica_, _144_(1), p.109. | "The rareness of reports about neurological side effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines may have several reasons. First, SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are available only since December 2020, why it may be simply too early to have got these cases published. Secondly, there may be a psychological inhibition to recognize and report side effects, as we all want to get rid of the global threat caused by the virus and want to return to normal life. Third, those who produce the vaccines and want to make money with their products may have a weak interest in hearing about side effects of their products why they may directly or indirectly try to avoid publications about putative adverse reactions. Fourth, there is enormous social, economic and political pressure on producers of vaccines and publishers of meeting current needs and providing an effective weapon against the pandemic, why positive reports are preferred over negative news about the handling of the global crisis".
[Review Article: Safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the EU: Should we be concerned?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8055532/) | Hernández, A.F., Calina, D., Poulas, K., Docea, A.O. and Tsatsakis, A.M., 2021. Safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the EU: Should we be concerned?. _Toxicology Reports_, _8_, pp.871-879. | "Data on long-term studies, interaction with other vaccines, use in pregnancy/breast-feeding, use in immunocompromised subjects, and in subjects with comorbidities, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are still missing for these vaccines. Therefore, careful follow-up and surveillance studies for continued vaccine safety monitoring will be needed to ascertain the potential risks of such adverse events or diseases." 

#### Statistics used to convey vaccine efficacy
This is an area I need to do much more research on as I am not too familiar with the measures used to report vaccine efficacy. From what I am reading so far:

- Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is the standard for reporting on vaccine efficacy. It is defined as follows, where Attack Rate Vaccinated and Attack Rate Unvaccinated refer to the cases in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations respectively.

![](https://i.imgur.com/83hghlk.gif)

- As [Olliaro et al.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext) highlights, "RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, while the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population". 

![](https://i.imgur.com/lDOtztE.gif)

- Some of the articles below suggest that the ARR is not very impressive when reported, as the risk of contracting COVID-19 is so low anyway, and that this is perhaps why the ARR is not commonly reported to show vaccine efficacy (or the lack thereof). 

- The Number Needed to Vaccinate/Treat (NNTV) is defined as the reciprocal of the ARR, and tells us how many people we need to vaccinate to prevent one case of COVID-19. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/NdMH6a4.gif)

- The [Walach et al.](https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_8c97b2396c2842b3b05975bfbd8254cb.pdf) study below is interesting, because it suggests that the NNTV may be disproportionately high, i.e. a large number of people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one case of COVID-19, and whether this is worth it or not since it opens up opportunities for vaccine side effects.

Klement, and Wouter Aukema. 2021. [The Safety of COVID-19 Vaccinations - Should We Rethink the Policy?](https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_8c97b2396c2842b3b05975bfbd8254cb.pdf) Sci, Publ Health Pol & Law 3:87-99. (Newly and Independently Peer-Reviewed (Single-Blind, 3 Reviewers) | This is an analysis that evaluates the risk-benefit of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using a measure called the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) in order to prevent one COVID-19 case or death. The data is from the Adverse Drug Reactions database of the Dutch National Register. The authors found that "The NNTV is between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer. NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval)". In addition, "Among those, there were 16 serious ICSRs (Individual Case Safety Reports), and the number of ICSRs reporting fatal side-effects was at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. Thus, for 6 (95% CI 2–11) deaths prevented by vaccination, there were approximately 4 deaths reported to Dutch Lareb that occurred after vaccination, yielding a potential risk/benefit ratio of 2:3".
[COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness—the elephant (not) in the room](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext) | Olliaro, P., Torreele, E. and Vaillant, M., 2021. COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness—the elephant (not) in the room. _The Lancet Microbe_. | "However, RRR should be seen against the background risk of being infected and becoming ill with COVID-19, which varies between populations and over time. Although the RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population. ARRs tend to be ignored because they give a much less impressive effect size than RRRs: 1·3% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford, 1·2% for the Moderna–NIH, 1·2% for the J&J, 0·93% for the Gamaleya, and 0·84% for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines". 
[Outcome Reporting Bias in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Clinical Trials](https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/199/htm) | Brown, R.B., 2021. Outcome reporting bias in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. _Medicina_, _57_(3), p.199. | "The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy (...) Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures."
[Response to "Covid-19: Vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective, interim results indicate"](https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4347/rr-4?fbclid=IwAR2PanlDKtX3qNd0MtvplhqENOSQ9yravW3fKwhBh0z08mQc4VNUFUNrsHs) | Mahase, E., 2020. Covid-19: Vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective, interim results indicate. | "Relative risk (RR) for vaccination = 0.093, which translates into a “vaccine effectiveness” of 90.7% [100(1-0.093)]. This sounds impressive, but the absolute risk reduction for an individual is only about 0.4% (0.0043-0.0004=0.0039). The Number Needed To Vaccinate (NNTV) = 256 (1/0.0039), which means that to prevent just 1 Covid-19 case 256 individuals must get the vaccine"


#### Potential Mechanisms of Vaccine Injury

[Thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination: Possible paths to platelet factor 4 autoimmunity](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003648) | Goldman, M. and Hermans, C., 2021. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination: Possible paths to platelet factor 4 autoimmunity. _PLoS medicine_, _18_(5), p.e1003648. (Published 24 May 2021) | In this review paper, the authors present evidence from a variety of studies that collectively, suggest that an autoimmune response to Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) underlies the pathology of both severe COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 adenovirus vector-based immunisation (i.e. with the Astrazeneca vaccine). Based on what is known so far, they propose a hypothetical model of the mechanism. This involves the hyperactivation of platelets, resulting in PF4 being released in the circulation. This is then followed by complexes forming between PF4 and endothelial cell-derived polyanionic PG. This stimulates B cells to produce anti-PF4 antibodies, which is responsible for the autoimmune response. Their model implies that it is the adenovirus vector itself that may be responsible for this effect. Interestingly, they do not discuss the mRNA-based vaccines including Pfizer. This is interesting, considering that thrombocytopenia has also been reported as an adverse effect of Pfizer vaccines at a level similar to Astrazeneca, while obviously not being based on an adenovirus vector, so it seems strange to not mention this important caveat in the Discussion. 
[Towards Understanding ChAdOx1 nCov-19 Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-440461/v1) | Greinacher, A., Selleng, K., Wesche, J., Handtke, S., Palankar, R., Aurich, K., Lalk, M., Methling, K., Völker, U., Hentschker, C. and Michalik, S., 2021. Towards understanding ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). | "Biophysical analyses showed formation of complexes between PF4 and vaccine constituents, including virus proteins that were recognized by VITT antibodies. EDTA, a vaccine constituent, increased microvascular leakage in mice allowing for circulation of virus- and virus-producing cell culture-derived proteins. Antibodies in normal sera cross-reacted with human proteins in the vaccine and likely contribute to commonly observed acute ChAdOx1 nCov-19 post-vaccination inflammatory reactions".
["Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry" Syndrome: Splice reactions within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike open reading frame result in Spike protein variants that may cause thromboembolic events in patients immunized with vector-based vaccines (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1) | Kowarz, E., Krutzke, L., Reis, J., Bracharz, S., Kochanek, S. and Marschalek, R., 2021. “Vaccine-Induced Covid-19 Mimicry” Syndrome: Splice reactions within the SARS-CoV-2 Spike open reading frame result in Spike protein variants that may cause thromboembolic events in patients immunized with vector-based vaccines. | "Unfortunately, severe side effects became overt during these vaccination campaigns: cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST), absolutely rare under normal life conditions, were found as a severe side effect that occured 4-14 days after first vaccinations. Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries (...) Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels."
[Process-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-477964/v1) | Krutzke, L., Roesler, R., Wiese, S. and Kochanek, S., 2021. Process-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. | This study identifies contamination of various kinds of human and non-structural viral proteins within the Astrazeneca vaccine, using biochemical and proteomic methods. They suggest that some of the adverse effects associated with vaccination may be due to some of these contaminant proteins. For example, heat shock protein was apparently abundant, and it is known for causing autoimmune responses in humans. The pathological mechanism here is not from the spike protein itself, but from the vaccine constituents. This raises an important concern regarding quality control. To what extent does quality control of different batches happen across the different vaccines? Are there any comparisons? Recently, [1.6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine were withdrawn in Japan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/1.6m-Moderna-doses-withdrawn-in-Japan-over-contamination) as there was contamination of a "a substance that reacts with magnets". How often does this occur in batches, and is anyone tracking this?
[Infection of brain pericytes underlying neuropathology of COVID-19 patients (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.24.445532v1.full) | Bocci, M., Oudenaarden, C., Sàenz-Sardà, X., Simrén, J., Edén, A., Sjölund, J., Möller, C., Gisslén, M., Zetterberg, H., Englund, E. and Pietras, K., 2021. Infection of brain pericytes underlying neuropathology of COVID-19 patients. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 25 May 2021) | This study uses multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n=6 COVID-19-afflicted brains and n=7 control brains), to show that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. Although the sample sizes are small, they found that the patients with neurological symptoms from COVID-19 appeared to consistently be those that also had higher ACE2 expression in peri-vascular cells. This suggests that the virus is compromising the blood-brain barrier through infection of these pericytes, and causing peri-vascular inflammation. This article addresses COVID-19 disease pathology and not vaccines specifically, but I have included it under this section as the authors mention in the Discussion that "overt endothelial cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to occur". They refer to a paper by [Rhea et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33328624/) that suggests that the spike protein of the virus is retained on endothelial cells. The authors speculate that this may be one potential avenue of exposing pericytes to being infected and hence neurological disturbances. An important question this research raises is - to what extent does this occur with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines? Does the spike protein from vaccines cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with endothelial cells or pericytes? Should people who have higher ACE2 expression refrain from being vaccinated for medical reasons?

Viral-induced enhanced disease illness. _Frontiers in microbiology_, _9_, p.2991. | This paper is from 2015, before any potential reporting bias with how contentious SARS-CoV2 vaccines are. A few sections describe SARS-CoV and appear relevant, e.g. "Wang et al. found that ADE response is stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins rather than nucleoproteins ([Wang et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02991/full#B159)). It was also shown in the same study that ADE response was dependent on antibody titers, as sera with high antibodies concentration neutralized the virus, while diluted sera significantly enhanced the infection and induced more apoptosis ([Wang et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02991/full#B159))".

Antibody-dependent enhancement and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies. _Nature microbiology_, _5_(10), pp.1185-1191. | Review article addressing ADE in the current vaccines, published in *Nature Microbiology*. Authors conclude that "Going forwards, it will be crucial to evaluate animal and clinical datasets for signs of ADE, and to balance ADE-related safety risks against intervention efficacy if clinical ADE is observed. Ongoing animal and human clinical studies will provide important insights into the mechanisms of ADE in COVID-19". Given that research is still ongoing, it doesn't make getting vaccinated now seem appealing at all.

Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID‐19 vaccines worsening clinical disease. _International journal of clinical practice_, _75_(3), p.e13795. | "COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials."

Infection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants. A potential risk for mass vaccination?. _Journal of Infection_. | "Current Covid-19 vaccines (either mRNA or viral vectors) are based on the original Wuhan spike sequence. Inasmuch as neutralizing antibodies overwhelm facilitating antibodies, ADE is not a concern. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may tip the scales in favor of infection enhancement. Our structural and modeling data suggest that it might be indeed the case for Delta variants. In conclusion, ADE may occur in people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors) and then exposed to a Delta variant."

Longitudinal analysis shows durable and broad immune memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection with persisting antibody responses and memory B and T cells. _Medrxiv_. (Posted 18 June 2021) | Longitudinal follow-up of 254 COVID-19 patients who recovered with natural immunity. This paper goes into detail regarding the immune response that has been built in these individuals who now have natural immunity. Antibodies targeted against the spike protein appear to be long-lasting (at least up to 8 months, the duration of the study), and there also appears to be cross-immunity that has developed to SARS-CoV-1 and other betacoronaviruses. "n addition, spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells persist, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure or vaccination. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days." The article also makes mention of antibodies targeted to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, and how this is important because "CD8+ T cell responses preferentially target the nucleoprotein". They then go on to mention that this is a potential limitation of current vaccines, which only target the spike and do not target other proteins including the nucleoprotein.

Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in naïve individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."

Recovery of deleted deep sequencing data sheds more light on the early Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. _bioRxiv_. | "The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains shrouded in mystery. Here I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH’s Sequence Read Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data further supports the idea that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of currently known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives."

Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19. _EClinicalMedicine_, p.101044. | This paper describes an interesting and concerning phenomenon (although no mechanistic explanation is proposed here). In patients who have recovered from COVID, cognitive deficits seem to remain, even if they didn't experience a lot of symptoms (although those who experienced severe symptoms and were on ventilators were the most affected). "The scale of the observed deficit was not insubstantial; the 0.47 SD global composite score reduction for the hospitalized with ventilator sub-group was greater than the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset. It was larger than the mean deficit of 480 people who indicated they had previously suffered a stroke (−0.24SDs) and the 998 who reported learning disabilities (−0.38SDs). For comparison, in a classic intelligence test, 0.47 SDs equates to a 7-point difference in IQ."

(2020). Over 33% of these recovered COVID-19 patients reported that they felt as bad on day 60 after symptom onset as they felt during their acute disease phase (Carvalho-Schneider et al. 2020). One explanatory hypothesis would be that for some individuals these peculiar symptoms and subpopulation mortality rates are the consequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections working in bidirectional synergy with one or more existing latent pathogen infections, by means of induced mutually beneficial immune cell dysfunctions, including T cell exhaustion (Zheng et al. 2020a, b; Varikuti et al. 2018; Xiao et al. 2018). Based on medical observations, the most plausible participating latent pathogen infection is the wide-spread protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (Varikuti et al. 2018; Xiao et al. 2018)."

SARS‐CoV‐2 biology and variants: anticipation of viral evolution and what needs to be done. _Environ Microbiol._ _23_(5). pp.2339–2363. | "However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine‐resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll‐out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic." Also "In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution."

SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant exhibits higher infectivity and immune resistance. _bioRxiv_. | As of late July 2021, the Lambda strain, a new variant detected in South America. It is more infectious due to T76I and L452Q mutations. In addition, "The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino-acid deletion mutation in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies."

The Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2 has a better chance than the Delta variant to escape vaccines. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 26 August 2021) | This pre-print article presents data suggesting that the mutations in the RBD of the Lambda strain may make it more likely to escape vaccine-mediated immunity than the Delta variant. "However, both mutations of F490S and L451Q lead to the disruptions of a hydrophobic patch, which is a critical area for the binding of broadly neutralizing antibodies. This is confirmed by antibody binding assays. The mutated RBD from the Lambda variant decreases the ability to recognize broadly neutralizing antibodies, and this explains why vaccinated people in Peru, who are vaccinated with inactivated viruses, still got infected by this variant".

Mapping mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that escape binding by different classes of antibodies. _Nature communications_, _12_(1), pp.1-14. | This is an interesting paper that proposes a framework by which to track the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the way in which mutations in certain parts of the virus (e.g. the Receptor Binding Domain or RBD) can contribute to evasion from antibody epitopes. This has important implications because the antibodies that are developed after infection with the virus are skewed towards a particular subset of epitopes. This means that if the virus continues to accumulate mutations, then it is possible that it may be able to completely evade much of the current immunity that has been developed. The paper groups the antibody epitopes developed by individuals into 3 classes, and note that currently there are variants that have mutations evading each of the classes, but not all 3 at the same time.  


### Vaccination Case Studies
Note: Although these effects are rare, the impression I am getting is that there is still much we don't understand about why these effects are happening, the potential pathological mechanisms involved (although autoimmune responses appear to be a recurring theme), and how bad the situation really is (autopsies were not always possible in many of these case studies).

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Impairs Endothelial Function via Downregulation of ACE 2. _Circulation research_, _128_(9), pp.1323-1326. | The implications of this article are startling - if true, then spike proteins have the potential to cause damage by themselves, even when they are not associated with a virus. In this study, the researchers create a “pseudovirus” that was surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model—proving that the spike protein alone appears enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls. Apparently previous studies have shown a similar effect when cells were exposed to the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, but this study shows that only the Spike protein is neccessary to cause this damage.

Furthermore, while human data on the possible long-term consequences of spike protein-based COVID-19 vaccines will not be available soon, it is imperative that appropriate experimental animal models are employed as soon as possible to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does not elicit any signs of the pathogenesis of PAH or any other chronic pathological conditions."

Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries (...) Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels."

## Herd Immunity
### Herd Immunity in Sweden
 Title | Reference | Notes
--- | --- | ---
[Indications that Stockholm has reached herd immunity, given limited restrictions, against several variants of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260167v1.full) | Carlsson, M. and Soderberg-Naucler, C., 2021. Indications that Stockholm has reached herd immunity, given limited restrictions, against several variants of SARS-CoV-2. _medRxiv_. (July 13 2021). | This is a very interesting analysis of the situation in Sweden. The analysis uses mathematical modelling to try and reconstruct the current herd immunity that we see in Sweden. They conclude that the combination of factors leading to herd immunity are not clear (e.g. whether it is due to lack of lockdowns, pre-existing immunity etc) but that it is unlikely to be due to mass-vaccination. The model estimates that in Sweden, herd immunity was reached in December 2020. 


### Pre-Existing Immunity
Title | Reference | Notes
--- | --- | ---
[Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity?](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563) | Doshi, P., 2020. Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity?. _Bmj_, _370_. | This is a short commentary article by Senior Editor Peter Doshi of *The BMJ*. Doshi refers to a number of studies suggesting that pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may exist in the population, although the exact proportion is unclear at this stage. Apparently, "at least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus." Although these studies are small and do not provide precise estimates of the numbers of people with pre-existig immunity, "they are hard to dismiss, with several being published in _Cell_ and _Nature_. Alessandro Sette, an immunologist from La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and an author of several of the studies, told _The BMJ_, “At this point there are a number of studies that are seeing this reactivity in different continents, different labs. As a scientist you know that is a hallmark of something that has a very strong footing.”" Interestingly, this phenomenon appears to have happened during the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic in 2009, where it was found that people had B and T cell pre-existing immunity, which was why the Swine Flu was causing less severe infections than was expected. I need to go through the articles cited here in detail, but an important question that this commentary raises is - to what extent is pre-existing immunity relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic? Is this why the severity of infection appears much less in places like Sweden, where they may have higher levels of pre-existing immunity? How can pre-existing immunity be obtained and who is predisposed to having it?

[FDA Letter to  BioNTech regarding approval of the COMINARTY vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/151710/download) | - | FDA letter released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge “the pharmacovigilance system (VAERS) that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.” FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

### Effectiveness of Early Treatments

#### Ivermectin
Title | Reference | Notes
--- | --- | ---
[Ivermectin for COVID-19: real-time meta analysis of 63 studies](https://ivmmeta.com/) | - | This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of papers relating to the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) in the treatment of COVID-19, at all three stages - prophylaxis, early treatment, and late treatment. The analysis is regularly updated as new studies come out, and all updates are documented in the [Revisions](https://ivmmeta.com/#revisions). The conclusion is that IVM appears effective at all three stages, but particularly so when used as prophylaxis or as early treatment. At the time of writing, there are 63 studies that have been included in the meta-analysis. The authors mention in their [FAQ](https://ivmmeta.com/faq.html) that they include as much of the research out there as possible. They state that: "Covering all research is important because it is easy to choose a search strategy that results in a subset of papers reporting a desired conclusion". From my own experiences, I agree. It is so easy to reach a desired conclusion by leaving out studies, and no matter what the "assumptions" are for doing so, it introduces human bias into the whole process. <br/><br/>The authors of this meta-analysis are anonymous, however, they also state on their FAQ page that "We are PhD researchers, scientists, people who hope to make a contribution, even if it is only very minor. You can find our research in journals like Science and Nature. We have little interest in adding to our publication lists, being in the news, or being on TV (we have done all of these things before but feel there are more important things in life now)." <br/><br/> They have also transparently provided all methods, statistical analysis, and sources that have been used, so that anyone can go in and independently verify their findings and reproduce the analysis. In my view, this is admirable, especially from my own experiences with how difficult and convoluted it can be to reproduce results in others' work. This is something I would eventually like to do (reproducing their analyses and digging into it more) so I can learn more about the methods they used. 
[Ivermectin for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis to Inform Clinical Guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248252/) | Bryant, A., Lawrie, T.A., Dowswell, T., Fordham, E.J., Scott, M., Hill, S.R. and Tham, T.C., 2021. Ivermectin for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis to inform clinical guidelines. (Published 21 June 2021) | This is a meta-analysis of 24 randomised control trials (RCTs) and 3-quasi RCTs, involving 3,406 participants in total. This meta-analysis has more stringent criteria for the inclusion of trials compared to the page above, only including RCTs (or quasi RCTs) as they are considered "the highest level of evidence", and they have excluded the "numerous observational but nonrandomized trials of ivermectin" that make up the majority of the studies in the meta-analysis above. Other than the more stringent inclusion criteria, the statistical analysis and methods used are very similar to those in the meta-analysis above, so it's likely that at least some of the authors may be the same. Despite including only a fraction of the studies, the authors found that ivermectin reduced the risk of death by an average of 62% compared to no ivermectin in hospitalised patients, which is a similar finding to the meta-analysis above. They also found weaker evidence that IVM is effective in prophylaxis and in prevention of severe illness from COVID-19 as well, although the strength of evidence was not as high as for the reduction of COVID-19 death. The authors note that "Most trials were registered, self-funded, and undertaken by clinicians working in the field. There were no obvious conflicts of interest noted, with the exception of two trials." 
[Evidence on the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19: another story of apples and oranges](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2021/08/19/bmjebm-2021-111791) | Popp, M., Kranke, P., Meybohm, P., Metzendorf, M.I., Skoetz, N., Stegemann, M.S. and Weibel, S., 2021. Evidence on the efficacy of ivermectin for COVID-19: another story of apples and oranges. _BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine_. | This article is a rebuttal to the meta-analysis above.

Posted 3 September 2021. | This is a response that rebuts the article above. From the Bryant et al. team, they point out the flaws and assumptions of the Popp et al. meta-analysis. This response highlights the core of science: open scientific debate. This is because situations are often complex and there is often not one "right" way to do something, despite what the mainstream media would suggest ("Follow the Science"). This applies even to meta-analysis studies that attempt to overcome this by pooling results from multiple studies and seeing if there is a common trend that is statistically significant. It is up to the reader to read through and evaluate these flaws, assumptions, and misleading statements in the Popp et al. study that Bryant et al. have now pointed out, and see if they sound reasonable.

[/r/CovidVaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/) | [/r/CovidVaccinated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/) | Subreddit containing experiences of people after being vaccinated, both good and bad. Every day there are multiple posts of quite alarming side effects. Moderators are active in removing threads, see [Reveddit archive](https://www.reveddit.com/v/covidvaccinated/?showFilters=true&localSort=score) for threads that have been removed. 
[Ivermectin MD Team](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3595465843801899/) | [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/3595465843801899/) ; [Mewe backup](https://mewe.com/join/ivermectinmdteam) | Facebook group with >19,000 members. Discussion focused on Ivermectin, including tips for sourcing from doctors, dosage, experiences, etc. The group's moderators are physicians. 
[NoNewNormal](https://communities.win/c/nonewnormal) | [/r/NoNewNormal (Quarantined)](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/) ; [.win /NoNewNormal](https://communities.win/c/nonewnormal) | /r/NoNewNormal is a subreddit focused around the discussion of things which don't fit the official COVID-19 narrative. Things like lockdowns, masks, vaccinations, associated politics, etc. The group was recently quarantined on Reddit (I think 11th August 2021), and has already gained 15,000 members in the next few days post-quarantine. Someone has also set up the group on communities.win in case the subreddit is banned. **Update 2 September 2021 - Subreddit was banned**. 
[COVID Vaccine Victims](http://t.me/CovidVaccineVictims) | [Website](https://www.covidvaccinevictims.com/) ; [Telegram group](http://t.me/CovidVaccineVictims) | This website invites people with adverse reactions to a SARS-CoV2 vaccine to submit their stories. I find that the Telegram group (>100,000 subscribers) is easiest to navigate, and there is an associated chat where people discuss each story. The information here can often be more detailed than that in VAERS.

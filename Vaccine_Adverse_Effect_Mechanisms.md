[Potential antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and human tissue with a possible link to an increase in autoimmune diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6078966/) | Vojdani, A. and Kharrazian, D., 2020. Potential antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and human tissue with a possible link to an increase in autoimmune diseases. _Clinical Immunology (Orlando, Fla.)_, _217_, p.108480. (Published 20 May 2020) | The authors suggests a mechanistic possibility of autoimmunity arising from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The mechanism involves antibodies being developed in response to the spike protein antigen from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, followed by these antibodies then cross-reacting with antigens naturally present in human tissue. <br><br>Human antigens which were found to exhibit significant cross-reactivity to spike protein antibodies included "transglutaminase 3 (tTG3), transglutaminase 2 (tTG2), ENA, myelin basic protein (MBP), mitochondria, nuclear antigen (NA), α-myosin, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), collagen, claudin 5+6, and S100B". The authors raise the possibility of autoimmunity being stimulated in different organs beyond just pulmonary tissue, including a variety of tissues like "connective tissue and the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems." <br><br>The authors ask the question, "Is it possible that some of the extensive organ, tissue, and cellular damage done by SARS-CoV-2 is due to viral antigenic mimicry with human tissue?", and that if the answer is yes, then "we may face an increase in the rates of autoimmune disease in the future, because any factor that causes chronic inflammation in the body can potentially induce autoimmune disease." <br><br>An important question raised by this article is whether a similar mechanism may underlie some of the vaccine-mediated adverse effects that appear to involve autoimmune mechanisms. This is particularly important considering that most of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based upon using the spike protein as an antigen to stimulate production of spike protein antibodies.

In reply to “potential antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and human tissue with a possible link to an increase in autoimmune diseases”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7833091/?report=classic#bb0005) | Talotta, R., 2021. Do COVID-19 RNA-based vaccines put at risk of immune-mediated diseases? In reply to “potential antigenic cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and human tissue with a possible link to an increase in autoimmune diseases”. _Clinical Immunology (Orlando, Fla.)_, _224_, p.108665. (Published 8 Jan 2021) | This is a letter to the editor in response to the Vojdani and Kharrazian (2020) article in the row above. Here, the author of this letter further expands upon how those findings could apply to the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.<br><br> The author highlights that "Vaccine-associated autoimmunity is a well-known phenomenon attributed to either the cross-reactivity between antigens or the effect of adjuvant", but that this is further complicated in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines which use mRNA technology. This is because, prior to translation of the mRNA, it is possible that "mRNA may bind pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in endosomes or cytosol. Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR8 are able to recognize chains of double-stranded (ds)RNA or single-stranded (ss)RNA in endosomes, while retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) may detect short and long filaments of dsRNA in the cytosol."<br><br> Importantly, "the up-regulation of these immunological pathways is widely considered to be at the basis of several immune-mediated diseases, especially in genetically predisposed subjects who have an impaired clearance of nucleic acids". <br><br>The author then writes, "This could particularly hold true in young female individuals, due to the over-expression of X-linked genes presiding over the antiviral response and the stimulatory effect played by estrogens on the immune system. The X chromosome hosts several genes involved in the immune response, including _TLR7_ and _TLR8_ genes, and about 10% of microRNAs indirectly controlling the activation of the immune system. <br><br>Therefore, young and female patients who are already affected or predisposed (_e.g._ immunological and serological abnormalities in absence of clinical symptoms, familiarity for immune-mediated diseases) to autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders should be carefully evaluated for the benefits and risks of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination".

Covid-19 vaccine and autoimmunity: Awakening the sleeping dragon. _Clinical Immunology (Orlando, Fla.)_. (Published 3 April 2021) | This is a letter to the editor that cites the letter by Talotta (2021) in the row above. This letter reports the case study of one 32-year-old health care worker, who sees recurrence of a skin rash with an autoimmune basis, following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. This happened after the first and second dose. The authors of this letter agree with the mechanism proposed in in the Talotta (2021) letter and "hypothesize that, even though, COVID-19 vaccination does not provoke de novo immune mediated adverse events, it is possible that, the immunologic response triggers pre-existing underlying dysregulated pathways".

[Review Article: Thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination: Possible paths to platelet factor 4 autoimmunity](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003648) | Goldman, M. and Hermans, C., 2021. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination: Possible paths to platelet factor 4 autoimmunity. _PLoS medicine_, _18_(5), p.e1003648. (Published 24 May 2021) | In this review paper, the authors present evidence from a variety of studies that collectively, suggest that an autoimmune response to Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) underlies the pathology of both severe COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 adenovirus vector-based immunisation (i.e. with the Astrazeneca vaccine). Based on what is known so far, they propose a hypothetical model of the mechanism. This involves the hyperactivation of platelets, resulting in PF4 being released in the circulation. This is then followed by complexes forming between PF4 and endothelial cell-derived polyanionic PG. This stimulates B cells to produce anti-PF4 antibodies, which is responsible for the autoimmune response. Their model implies that it is the adenovirus vector itself that may be responsible for this effect. Interestingly, they do not discuss the mRNA-based vaccines including Pfizer. This is interesting, considering that thrombocytopenia has also been reported as an adverse effect of Pfizer vaccines at a level similar to Astrazeneca, while obviously not being based on an adenovirus vector, so it seems strange to not mention this important caveat in the Discussion.

Towards understanding ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). | "Biophysical analyses showed formation of complexes between PF4 and vaccine constituents, including virus proteins that were recognized by VITT antibodies. EDTA, a vaccine constituent, increased microvascular leakage in mice allowing for circulation of virus- and virus-producing cell culture-derived proteins. Antibodies in normal sera cross-reacted with human proteins in the vaccine and likely contribute to commonly observed acute ChAdOx1 nCov-19 post-vaccination inflammatory reactions".

These get into the blood and then bind to the surface of cells that line blood vessels, contributing to VITT and CVST.<br><br> "Unfortunately, severe side effects became overt during these vaccination campaigns: cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST), absolutely rare under normal life conditions, were found as a severe side effect that occured 4-14 days after first vaccinations. Besides CVST, Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis (SVT) was also observed. This type of adverse event has not been observed in the clinical studies of AstraZeneca, and therefore led immediately to a halt in vaccinations in several european countries (...) Here, we present data that may explain these severe side effects which have been attributed to adenoviral vaccines. According to our results, transcription of wildtype and codon-optimized Spike open reading frames enables alternative splice events that lead to C-terminal truncated, soluble Spike protein variants. These soluble Spike variants may initiate severe side effects when binding to ACE2-expressing endothelial cells in blood vessels."<br><br> [*Nature Briefings*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02291-2) has covered this briefly, and they state:<br><br> "And the lower rate of clots in J&J’s vaccine compared with Oxford–AstraZeneca’s could be because the version of spike generated by the J&J vaccine was engineered to remove the sites that allow the RNA to be processed into splice variants, says Marschalek."<br><br> "Marschalek thinks that if this idea is borne out, then the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine and other adenovirus-based vaccines could be rendered safer if their versions of spike were similarly engineered."

The roles of platelets in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. _Trends in cardiovascular medicine_. (Published 27 August 2021). | Review article that addresses the condition known as Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The authors summarise the existing literature on this emerging condition that seems to be associated with vectored vaccines particularly (e.g. AstraZeneca).<br><br>Current evidence suggests the following mechanism in VITT: "The current evidences suggest spike-protein can trigger the production of anti- platelet factor 4 antibody, and the immunogenicity of vectored vaccine is more potent in terms of anti- platelet factor 4 antibody production, but other missing links should be found to explain the higher prevalence of VITT in the vectored vaccines."<br><br>The authors point out apparent differences in the incidence of VITT between vector and mRNA vaccines: "VITT-like adverse events are also rarely found in mRNA vaccines. Cari et al. [64] reported the adverse events expressed by bleeding and clot with thrombocytopenia were 3.3 and 15.1/100,000 doses in mRNA and virus-vectored vaccine recipients, respectively. The severe cases were documented 0.4 and 3.0 cases, and death rate was 0.04 and 0.48/100,000 doses for mRNA and vectored vaccine recipients, respectively" and suggest that "the mechanism of the different reactions among vaccines should be examined more thoroughly". <br><br>The authors point out how VITT often occurs in the brain in the venous sinus: "The perplexing mystery in VITT is why the thrombosis frequently occurs in cerebral venous sinus." "Some unknown events that occur after vaccination in the intracranial space must be figured out to explain the high prevalence of CVST. Pons et al. [68] delineated the ACE2 expression on the blood vessels of the brain, and the different distribution of ACE2 can be the hint to solve the mystery [75]." This is interesting considering we are told that the vaccine constituents are meant to stay near the injection site in the arm. Why is spike protein crossing the blood brain barrier? <br><br>Many unknowns still exist, as the authors ask: "Are there any specific backgrounds or comorbidities related to the risk of VITT? Are there any genetic risks for the recipients? These additional questions also need to be answered".

[Process-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-477964/v1) | Krutzke, L., Roesler, R., Wiese, S. and Kochanek, S., 2021. Process-related impurities in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine. | This study identifies contamination of various kinds of human and non-structural viral proteins within the AstraZeneca adenovirus vaccine, using biochemical and proteomic methods. They suggest that some of the adverse effects associated with vaccination may be due to some of these contaminant proteins. For example, heat shock protein 90 was apparently abundant, and it is known for causing autoimmune responses in humans:<br>"Extracellular HSPs modulate innate and adaptive immune-responses, can exacerbate pre-existing inflammatory condition, have been associated with autoimmunity and can even become target of auto-immune responses themselves".<br><br>The pathological mechanism described here is not from the spike protein itself, but from the vaccine constituents: "The often-observed strong clinical reaction one or two days after vaccination is likely associated with the detected protein impurities. A linkage to later immune-related adverse events is also conceivable.<br><br>Concerningly, the amount of contamination seems to vary when three different lots of the AstraZeneca vaccine were tested. This raises an important concern regarding quality control. To what extent does quality control of different batches happen across the different vaccines? Are there any comparisons? Recently, [1.6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine were withdrawn in Japan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/1.6m-Moderna-doses-withdrawn-in-Japan-over-contamination) as there was contamination of a "a substance that reacts with magnets". How often does this occur in batches, and is anyone tracking this?<br><br>See also: [this Twitter thead](https://mobile.twitter.com/drjohnb2/status/1413464001191763974?s=21) summarising the main findings of this paper and some of the other papers in this table below.

[Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927) | Li, C., Chen, Y., Zhao, Y., Lung, D.C., Ye, Z., Song, W., Liu, F.F., Cai, J.P., Wong, W.M., Yip, C.C.Y. and Chan, J.F.W., 2021. Intravenous Injection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine Can Induce Acute Myopericarditis in Mouse Model. _Clinical Infectious Diseases_. (Published 18 August 2021). | The study compared intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) mRNA vaccine injection with normal saline (NS) control in mice and examined morphological changes to organs as well as cytokines/immunological changes. The main finding was that IV injection could cause myocarditis in mice. However, this was not seen in IM injection. The authors posit that accidental IV injection in humans may be a cause of myocarditis. However, it is important to note that this paper (and particularly their Supplementary Data) shows subtle effects (cytokine/immune responses as well as ballooning hepatocytes) in some mice subjected to IM injection as well. These mice were not monitored long-term so it is unclear whether these more subtle pathological changes would have gotten worse with time.<br><br>The spike antigen was found to be expressed both in the heart and injection site of all mice and a booster dose appears to make this worse. This has implications for repeated boosters in humans:  <br>“Spike antigen expression by immunostaining was occasionally found in infiltrating immune cells of the heart or injection site, in cardiomyocytes and intracardiac vascular endothelial cells, but not skeletal myocytes. The histological changes of myopericarditis after the first IV-priming dose persisted for 2 weeks and were markedly aggravated by a second IM- or IV-booster dose.”<br><br>The authors posit that the problem of myocarditis appears to only be present in the IV (intravenously) injected mice and not the IM:  <br>“Cardiac tissue mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)-β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α increased significantly from 1 dpi to 2 dpi in the IV group but not the IM group, compatible with presence of myopericarditis in the IV group.”<br><br>Strangely, the authors claim that "the amount of COVID-19 mRNA Spike-RBD gene copies in heart tissues was significantly higher in IV than IM group at 1 dpi (Supplementary Figure 3). However, on looking at this figure, there is n=8 in IV group and only n=5 in the IM group and honestly the Spike mRNA levels do look very comparable between the groups. It is not clear why there are less samples in the IM group and I wonder if more samples would cause the significance to disappear especially as several IM samples show quite high levels of Spike mRNA.<br><br>Concerningly, it seems that the spike protein/vaccine has the potential to affect other organs beyond the heart. Although there were no significant morphological changes in other organs, IV mice show significantly altered cytokine/chemokine levels in other organs, including in the brain (where IL-6, TNF-a and IL-1B showed significant increases; Supplementary Figure 1D), and also other changes are seen in the liver and lung as well, confirming that the effects of spike protein are not localised to the injection site, but affect other organs as well. This is consistent with the Japan biodistribution data from Pfizer.<br><br>The authors do not focus on the IM mice a lot in their findings and discussion, but there are some interesting observations in the paper. IM mice do not show a myocarditis phenotype and pathology appears subtle morphologically. The only detectable changes were “significant weight loss and higher serum cytokine/chemokine levels were found in IM group at 1–2 days post-injection (dpi)”. However, digging into the Supplementary Data, we find that Supplementary Figure 1 indicates that in IM mice, “H&E images of the liver showed mild hepatocyte degeneration after IM vaccine at 2dpi”. In addition, 3 out of 6 IM mice have "hepatocytes ballooning degeneration" (Fig 8A) while all 6 IV mice suffered from this. Given that these effects appear subtle or inconsistent across the IM mice, it will be interesting to use other techniques (E.g. proteomics or next generation sequencing) to look at these subtle changes at the molecular level, and also monitor these mice for a longer time in future experiments. It is concerning that the spike protein makes its way into the liver and that this has the potential to cause damage in some people. Hepatitis has been reported in some humans after COVID-19 vaccination, and shown to be the definitive cause of at least one case of vaccine-induced hepatitis, where ballooning hepatocytes were also evident in this patient ([Tun et al. 2021](https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(21)02093-6/fulltext)). Given this, it is particularly concerning we see ballooning hepatocytes in some of the IM mice. <br><br>Interestingly, there do appear to be sex-specific differences in chemokine/cytokine levels in response to vaccination (Supplementary Figure 2). In the heart, female mice have higher expression of IFN-a, IFN-b, IL-6 and TNF-a. According to [VigiAccess](https://vigiaccess.org/) and [EudraVigilance](https://dap.ema.europa.eu/analytics/saw.dll?PortalPages&PortalPath=%2Fshared%2FPHV%20DAP%2F_portal%2FDAP&Action=Navigate&P0=1&P1=eq&P2=%22Line%20Listing%20Objects%22.%22Substance%20High%20Level%20Code%22&P3=1+42325700) databases, the majority of adverse events occur in women, so this observation is interesting and consistent with what we see in humans so far.

Infection of brain pericytes underlying neuropathology of COVID-19 patients. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 25 May 2021) | This study uses multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n=6 COVID-19-afflicted brains and n=7 control brains), to show that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. Although the sample sizes are small, they found that the patients with neurological symptoms from COVID-19 appeared to consistently be those that also had higher ACE2 expression in peri-vascular cells. This suggests that the virus is compromising the blood-brain barrier through infection of these pericytes, and causing peri-vascular inflammation. This article addresses COVID-19 disease pathology and not vaccines specifically, but I have included it under this section as the authors mention in the Discussion that "overt endothelial cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to occur". They refer to a paper by [Rhea et al. 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33328624/) that suggests that the spike protein of the virus is retained on endothelial cells. The authors speculate that this may be one potential avenue of exposing pericytes to being infected and hence neurological disturbances. An important question this research raises is - to what extent does this occur with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines? Does the spike protein from vaccines cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with endothelial cells or pericytes? Should people who have higher ACE2 expression refrain from being vaccinated for medical reasons?

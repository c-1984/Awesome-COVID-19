[Indications that Stockholm has reached herd immunity, given limited restrictions, against several variants of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.07.21260167v1.full) | Carlsson, M. and Soderberg-Naucler, C., 2021. Indications that Stockholm has reached herd immunity, given limited restrictions, against several variants of SARS-CoV-2. _medRxiv_. (July 13 2021). | This is a very interesting analysis of the situation in Sweden. The analysis uses mathematical modelling to try and reconstruct the current herd immunity that we see in Sweden. They conclude that the combination of factors leading to herd immunity are not clear (e.g. whether it is due to lack of lockdowns, pre-existing immunity etc) but that it is unlikely to be due to mass-vaccination. The model estimates that in Sweden, herd immunity was reached in December 2020.

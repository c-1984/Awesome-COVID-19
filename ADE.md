[Infection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants. A potential risk for mass vaccination?](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(21)00392-3/fulltext) | Yahi, N., Chahinian, H. and Fantini, J., 2021. Infection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants. A potential risk for mass vaccination?. _Journal of Infection_. | This article is a letter to the editor that brings attention to the emerging evidence that "ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors" when they are then exposed to the Delta strain. 
[Two Different Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) Risks for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.640093/full) | Ricke, D.O., 2021. Two Different Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) Risks for SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies. _Frontiers in immunology_, _12_, p.443. | "Development of vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus has been difficult to create due to vaccine induced enhanced disease responses in animal models (...) These models place increased emphasis on the importance of developing safe SARS-CoV-2 T cell vaccines that are not dependent upon antibodies."

Viral-induced enhanced disease illness. _Frontiers in microbiology_, _9_, p.2991. | This paper is from 2015, before any potential reporting bias with how contentious SARS-CoV2 vaccines are. A few sections describe SARS-CoV and appear relevant, e.g. "Wang et al. found that ADE response is stimulated by antibodies against SARS-CoV spike proteins rather than nucleoproteins ([Wang et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02991/full#B159)). It was also shown in the same study that ADE response was dependent on antibody titers, as sera with high antibodies concentration neutralized the virus, while diluted sera significantly enhanced the infection and induced more apoptosis ([Wang et al., 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02991/full#B159))".

Antibody-dependent enhancement and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies. _Nature microbiology_, _5_(10), pp.1185-1191. | Review article addressing ADE in the current vaccines, published in *Nature Microbiology*. Authors conclude that "Going forwards, it will be crucial to evaluate animal and clinical datasets for signs of ADE, and to balance ADE-related safety risks against intervention efficacy if clinical ADE is observed. Ongoing animal and human clinical studies will provide important insights into the mechanisms of ADE in COVID-19". Given that research is still ongoing, it doesn't make getting vaccinated now seem appealing at all. 
[Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID‐19 vaccines worsening clinical disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7645850/) | Cardozo, T. and Veazey, R., 2021. Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID‐19 vaccines worsening clinical disease. _International journal of clinical practice_, _75_(3), p.e13795. | "COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID‐19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials."

Infection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants. A potential risk for mass vaccination?. _Journal of Infection_. | "Current Covid-19 vaccines (either mRNA or viral vectors) are based on the original Wuhan spike sequence. Inasmuch as neutralizing antibodies overwhelm facilitating antibodies, ADE is not a concern. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may tip the scales in favor of infection enhancement. Our structural and modeling data suggest that it might be indeed the case for Delta variants. In conclusion, ADE may occur in people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors) and then exposed to a Delta variant."

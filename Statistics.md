## Vaccine Efficacy

- Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is the standard for reporting on vaccine efficacy. It is defined as follows, where Attack Rate Vaccinated and Attack Rate Unvaccinated refer to the cases in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations respectively.

- As [Olliaro et al.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext) highlights, "RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, while the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population".

- Some of the articles below suggest that the ARR is not very impressive when reported, as the risk of contracting COVID-19 is so low anyway, and that this is perhaps why the ARR is not commonly reported to show vaccine efficacy (or the lack thereof). 

- The Number Needed to Vaccinate/Treat (NNTV) is defined as the reciprocal of the ARR, and tells us how many people we need to vaccinate to prevent one case of COVID-19.

- The [Walach et al.](https://cf5e727d-d02d-4d71-89ff-9fe2d3ad957f.filesusr.com/ugd/adf864_8c97b2396c2842b3b05975bfbd8254cb.pdf) study below is interesting, because it suggests that the NNTV may be disproportionately high, i.e. a large number of people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one case of COVID-19. The authors here question whether vaccination is worth it or not when weighed against the possibility of adverse effects.

(Newly and Independently Peer-Reviewed (Single-Blind, 3 Reviewers) | This is an analysis that evaluates the risk-benefit of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using a measure called the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) in order to prevent one COVID-19 case or death. The data is from the Adverse Drug Reactions database of the Dutch National Register. The authors found that "The NNTV is between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer. NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval)". In addition, "Among those, there were 16 serious ICSRs (Individual Case Safety Reports), and the number of ICSRs reporting fatal side-effects was at 4.11/100,000 vaccinations. Thus, for 6 (95% CI 2–11) deaths prevented by vaccination, there were approximately 4 deaths reported to Dutch Lareb that occurred after vaccination, yielding a potential risk/benefit ratio of 2:3".

COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness—the elephant (not) in the room. _The Lancet Microbe_. | "However, RRR should be seen against the background risk of being infected and becoming ill with COVID-19, which varies between populations and over time. Although the RRR considers only participants who could benefit from the vaccine, the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference between attack rates with and without a vaccine, considers the whole population. ARRs tend to be ignored because they give a much less impressive effect size than RRRs: 1·3% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford, 1·2% for the Moderna–NIH, 1·2% for the J&J, 0·93% for the Gamaleya, and 0·84% for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines".

Outcome reporting bias in COVID-19 mRNA vaccine clinical trials. _Medicina_, _57_(3), p.199. | "The absence of reported absolute risk reduction in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials can lead to outcome reporting bias that affects the interpretation of vaccine efficacy (...) Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures."

Covid-19: Vaccine candidate may be more than 90% effective, interim results indicate. | "Relative risk (RR) for vaccination = 0.093, which translates into a “vaccine effectiveness” of 90.7% [100(1-0.093)]. This sounds impressive, but the absolute risk reduction for an individual is only about 0.4% (0.0043-0.0004=0.0039). The Number Needed To Vaccinate (NNTV) = 256 (1/0.0039), which means that to prevent just 1 Covid-19 case 256 individuals must get the vaccine"

## Definition of "Fully Vaccinated"

- CDC definition of "fully vaccinated" as being 14 days vaccination may be obscuring data, as risk of being infected increases within 14 days post-vaccination, according to a Danish study.

- Australian biotech company Vaxine sets up crowdfunding to raise funds for the approval of their locally-developed protein subunit vaccine, Covax-19, after failing to get any support from the Australian government. Covax-19 has shown strong protection against the Delta variant in a Phase 3 clinical trial in the Middle East. However, the Australian government has chosen instead to spend billions of dollars to produce UK-based AstraZeneca’s adenovirus vector vaccine: https://www.gofundme.com/f/bringing-covax19-back-to-australia

- Massive, unreported protests in Trieste, Italy, have been occurring this whole week, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to protest mandatory vaccination and the Green Pass. Surprisingly, while public footage is abundant on Twitter, this is not being reported across any mainstream media. There is evidence that “live webcams” are being manipulated by replacing current footage with past footage to make it appear that the areas full of people are empty.  https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/protest-in-trieste-we-the-people https://twitter.com/BernieSpofforth/status/1450208428740255744?s=20 

- Australian Professor, Dr Thomas Borody, reports successful and safe treatment of 600 Covid-19 patients from Sydney and Melbourne with the ivermectin triple therapy protocol he has developed (ivermectin used with doxycycline and zinc). Unfortunately, the study was terminated when the Australian government banned GPs from prescribing ivermectin on 10 September 2021. https://trialsitenews.com/combination-therapy-for-covid-19-based-on-ivermectin-in-an-australian-population/ PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqkz0qnGJYX-Mel-XFchAcW2sc1C_6pq/view?usp=sharing 

- Realisation that including the Individual Health Identifier on Australian vaccination certificates is a “bad mistake”. It turns out that, “You face up to two years imprisonment for use or disclosure of the IHI for any purposes outside of supporting healthcare. And now that number is on a PDF that is being emailed around willy nilly.” https://www.afr.com/technology/terrible-mistake-could-send-execs-to-jail-over-vaccine-certificates-20211015-p590am PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIS3KkTD8LGCUWQvLBCwzZcRC5CP4tNv/view?usp=sharing 

- In Australia, police are apparently trying to forcibly vaccinate Aboriginal people. A video has surfaced showing them defending themselves from police officers using a bow and arrow. https://twitter.com/ChooseLove777/status/1450119176824180739?s=20 

18 October 2021
- Colin Powell, 84, fully vaccinated, dies of COVID-19. The highest profile “rare”, “mild”, breakthrough case of COVID-19 we have heard about so far. USAToday: “Although dying from COVID-19 is extremely uncommon among the fully vaccinated, health experts say age and preexisting medical conditions may increase the odds of breakthrough infection, severe disease and even death.” (Interesting that older people / those with preexisting medical conditions were originally the ones who were recommended to take the vaccine in the first place to protect themselves…) https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/10/18/vaccine-covid-19-colin-powell-high-risk/8505663002/ 

- French biotech company Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001, reports promising results from their Phase III trials. VLA2001 is a whole virus, inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine candidate that uses analogous technology to traditional vaccines, except that the density of spike protein on the virus has been increased. Apparently, there are less adverse events than AstraZeneca, and efficacy also appears good, with participants building immunity to S, N, and M proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (It is interesting that despite not taking only a few months longer to create, all other pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna, chose to use a novel mRNA technology instead of proven traditional technologies.) https://trialsitenews.com/valneva-reports-its-covid-19-vaccine-vla200-candidate-is-superior-to-astrazenecas-in-phase-3-cov-compare-trial/ PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eOoK5B1X7sOtn02EpgUbHiOKBQV1RSYF/view?usp=sharing

- COVID-19 Surveillance Report data from the UK indicates that the vaccinated are experiencing more infections than the unvaccinated. “This is definitely a pandemic of the vaccinated that is killing mostly the vaccinated at this point.” https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/uks-vaccine-hell-gets-worse-every 

- Healthy 37-year-old police officer from Western Australia suffers debilitating side effects from the first Pfizer shot, including a ruptured artery to her brain, causing a stroke. Doctor tells her it is worth the risk of having another stroke to get her second shot and be fully vaccinated. https://www.facebook.com/100014682258220/posts/1249618398870890/?d=n 

15 October 2021
- Bombshell manuscript published in The Journal of Immunology, showing that spike proteins are expressed on the surface of exosomes after mRNA vaccination, and the exosomes continue to circulate in the blood for 4 MONTHS. This provides a clear mechanism whereby the effects of spike protein reach different organs (especially as they are expressed on the surface of exosomes). (This evidence is also consistent with the Pfizer biodistribution data made available by FOIA in Japan showing that lipid nanoparticles accumulated in organs including ovaries.) https://www.jimmunol.org/content/early/2021/10/11/jimmunol.2100637 https://twitter.com/kevin_mckernan/status/1450514230625517569?s=21 

- The Guardian asks people on Twitter for any stories about losing loved ones to COVID-19. This backfires, as the vast majority of replies overwhelmingly describe vaccine adverse effects. https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1448928379839864834?s=21 See 10 September for the exact same thing that happened with a different news company.

13 October 2021
- Alex Berenson brings attention to Intel, one of the only companies that is using evidence-based policy regarding the COVID-19 vaccinations, including “vaccinated employees cannot say they do not want to work with unvaccinated employees. (Policy 8.4)”. Also “Intel FORBIDS managers from asking for vaccination status. (Policy 8.13)”, and “Intel ACCEPTS antibodies as a full substitute for vaccination for people who must quarantine after a Covid exposure or for travel requirements.

12 October 2021
- High rate of menstrual side effects from vaccination surfaces. Pre-print research released detailing results from a survey of >39,000 women, with over half of them experiencing menstrual irregularities after COVID-19 vaccination. Notably, some groups of women who are not supposed to menstruate (those on the pill/contraceptives, women taking testosterone to transition into trans-men, women who are post-menopausal) are experiencing “breakthrough” periods at a startlingly high rate. No explanation as yet for why this is happening. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.11.21264863v1

11 October 2021
- Israeli Ministry of Health finds that booster shots in Israel are not preventing infections, so they have resorted to retroactively falsifying the data to show the conclusions they want. Fortunately, some people took screenshots documenting the changes: “For example (as can be seen it in the screenshots below, released by the council), if originally on a given day there were 118 vaccinated confirmed cases vs 242 unvaccinated - it suddenly became 10 vaccinated vs. 350 unvaccinated," Koren explains. "That is, blatant changes, which our examination shows were made over months. They did not just 'round' corners - but actually drastically re-wrote the whole history.”

- Deaths are at an all-time high in Singapore, despite the fact that 83% of the country is fully-vaccinated, most of them with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. The data from COVID-19 data repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) show that the vaccines are not working to reduce transmission or death. https://trialsitenews.com/despite-heavy-vaccination-delta-variant-covid-19-infections-deaths-surges-in-singapore/ Article behind paywall, see PDF here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Ws27wxgHqqU-Jkd0i0_yU9H5UaZ_oS4/view?usp=sharing

- Biden’s speech remarks are sounding increasingly authoritarian, blaming the unvaccinated using blatantly divisive language: “The fact is, this has been a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units. The unvaccinated patients are — are leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation and so much more because they can’t get into the ICU”. He even blames the unvaccinated for the worsening economy: “The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out.” He appears proud that people have gotten fired over their refusal to be vaccinated: “Let’s be clear: When you see headlines and reports of “mass firings” and “hundreds” of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/10/07/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-importance-of-covid-19-vaccine-requirements/ https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/q4b4bv/im_getting_super_worried_about_joe_bidens/

6 October 2021
- Sweden suspends use of Moderna vaccine for those under 30, Denmark said those under 18 won’t be offered the Moderna vaccine, and Norway urged those under 30 to get the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna. “All three countries based their decision on an unpublished study with Sweden’s Public Health Agency saying that it signals “an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium” with those under 30 at particularly higher risk. https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-denmark-public-health-health-453163d8f93618fde90c06d3474921a0 (This is interesting considering that a single dose of the Moderna vaccine contains 100ug of spike protein mRNA while a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine contains only 30ug of spike protein mRNA, suggesting spike protein mRNA may have dose-dependent toxicity. https://kamal-mokeddem.medium.com/spike-protein-a-dose-dependent-killer-2e26ec28de3f) Also see 29 September 2021 for a similar decision by Ontario, Canada.

4 October 2021
- Waning immunity of the Pfizer vaccine has now made it into mainstream media. (I guess the difference between a conspiracy theory and fact is only 6 months 🙃) CNBC: “The effectiveness of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine against infection tumbles over several months, falling from a peak of 88% a month after receiving the two-shot series to 47% six months later.” https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/pfizer-covid-vaccine-protection-against-infection-tumbles-to-47percent-study-confirms.html

- Multiple strands of evidence of adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines have now become evident. From dose-dependent increases in cytokines/chemokines, to the high correlation between mRNA dose and fatality rate (particularly relevant as mRNA dose is higher in Moderna than Pfizer), some of the recent evidence is summarised here: https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/mechanistic-evidence-of-vaccine-induced 

3 October 2021
- Israel pushing ahead with its redefinition of “fully vaccinated” to mean 3 doses. Previously fully-vaccinated (2 dose) Israelis will now lose their vaccine passports as they have not received the third dose: “As of Thursday, some 1.6 million Israelis who are entitled to receive the third dose of the coronavirus vaccine still have not done so, meaning they will be ineligible for the new green passport.” https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/covid-vaccination-pass-israel-about-to-expire-here-s-how-to-get-a-new-one-1.10255927

- The number of COVID-19 cases has increased over the past few months but this is misleading, because the definition of a “case” has changed. The % of cases that are asymptomatic has been gradually increasing over the past few months. “From March 2020 through early January 2021 — before vaccination was widespread, and before the Delta variant had arrived — the proportion of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease was 36 percent. From mid-January through the end of June 2021, however, that number rose to 48 percent.” https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/covid-hospitalization-numbers-can-be-misleading/620062/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=all

- Hospital in Texas may be forced to close, due to 20-25% of healthcare workers choosing to remain unvaccinated despite the vaccine mandate. Brownfield Regional Medical Center CEO Jerry Jasper: “I think the mandate is just a terrible message because if the vaccinations are working, why do you have to mandate people to get the vaccines?” Gray asked. “What happens to individual choice and medical decisions between the patient and their doctor, which is all of the things that we’re trying to support.” https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/texas-hospital-faces-closure-over-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-ceo_3998746.html

- ABC News brings attention to how Twitter does not reflect general Australian views: “In the Australian corner of Twitter, the space is dominated by views that are militantly pro-lockdown, pro-COVID zero and pro-Labor premiers, and even the tamest of questions in those directions prompts an onslaught. Topics currently guaranteed to trigger a pile-on include data from official sources that highlights the minimal risks to children from COVID; reporting about the unintended costs of lockdowns including Australians stranded overseas and harm to mental health; information about how safe the AstraZeneca vaccine is” https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-14/twitter-social-media-bullies-political-journalism/100458714

- Data from Israel surfaces, showing that 1,400 active COVID-19 cases in partially-vaccinated 12-15 year-olds suddenly disappear after the definition of being "fully vaccinated" is changed. The new definition of "fully vaccinated" now requires 3 doses in Israel, with 2 doses considered "partially vaccinated". However, the 1,400 COVID-19 cases in those previously considered to be "partially vaccinated" (1 dose, before the definition changed) have disappeared and they have not been "moved" to the "unvaccinated" group either. This raises questions regarding the lack of data transparency and whether the data are being potentially manipulated to make it appear that COVID-19 cases in 12-15 year olds are not increasing after vaccination. https://twitter.com/connolly_s/status/1437366313689796611/photo/1  Archive: https://archive.md/JN78y 

- Nicki Minaj makes a “controversial” tweet about a vaccine adverse effect on her cousin’s friend’s testicles that gets her banned from Twitter.

- The Lancet publishes a commentary saying that “the currently available evidence does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccination in populations that have received an effective primary vaccination regimen”.

- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/ 

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July.

- Pfizer and BioNTech release 6 month data for mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, claiming 91.3% vaccine efficacy and 100% effectiveness for preventing severe hospitalisation. https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx

- FOIA request filed by a group of Australian doctors (Covid Medical Network) reveals that the TGA never saw or requested individual patient data from Pfizer and simply assumed their reporting/summaries on safety data were true. https://covidmedicalnetwork.com/open-letters/FOI-2289-relevant-documents_Redacted.pdf 

23 March 2021
- Pfizer announces phase 1 trials for its new antiviral drug which will be in a pill form. The drug has showed potent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro but not yet in vivo. “Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires both prevention via vaccine and targeted treatment for those who contract the virus.” Wow. If only we already had drugs with antiviral activity and effectiveness shown through 40+ peer reviewed studies! 🤦‍♀️ https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-1-study-novel-oral-antiviral 

22 March 2021
- Preprint research find that a second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccine has different effects on naive vs COVID-recovered patients. “On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.” https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1 

- A GP from Celbridge was suspended for refusing to administer SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to his patients. “My problem primarily is that I don’t think the pathogenicity of Covid is sufficiently severe to a. cause lockdowns or b. use a messenger RNA [vaccine],” he said as he expressed concern over the safety of the shots” https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/gp-suspended-by-medical-council-over-refusal-to-give-covid-19-vaccine-1.4516239 

11 March 2021
- Getting vaccinated with Pfizer after recovering with natural immunity actually reduces immunity. This suggests that people who have natural immunity should not be further immunised through vaccination: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1 

9 March 2021
- AHPRA puts out a position statement to discourage registered health practitioners and students from speaking out on potential concerns regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations: "Any promotion of anti-vaccination statements or health advice which contradicts the best available scientific evidence or seeks to actively undermine the national immunisation campaign (including via social media) is not supported by National Boards and may be in breach of the codes of conduct and subject to investigation and possible regulatory action."

- NPR on waning vaccine immunity due to evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: “We're not going to fall off a cliff tomorrow in terms of vaccine efficacy. What we're likely to see is a slow, steady erosion of efficacy over, perhaps, quite a long period of time.” https://www.npr.org/2021/02/09/965703047/vaccines-could-drive-the-evolution-of-more-covid-19-mutants

26 January 2021
- Vaccine rollout in Israel results in new adverse events like paresthesia and facial nerve paralysis that were not picked up in the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial. Prof. Galia Rahav, chief of the Infectious Disease Unit and Laboratories at the Sheba Medical Center: “At the beginning, they [Pfizer] said that it was just hysterical women, but it doesn’t seem that way, because we’re seeing this with men as well.” https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/295623 

6 January 2021
- Agreement between the State of Israel , the Israeli Ministry of Health, and Pfizer Inc. is released, describing how Pfizer’s vaccine will be rolled out in Israel. This agreement indicates that Israel will provide data to Pfizer about its experimental novel-technology mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, so that Pfizer can determine "whether herd immunity is achieved after reaching a certain percentage of vaccination coverage in Israel". It is not clear what benefits Israel is getting in return for this agreement. https://govextra.gov.il/media/30806/11221-moh-pfizer-collaboration-agreement-redacted.pdf Backup: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SyV0SBNDyg7259DDB3TZL99CNP2G33CG/view?usp=sharing

- AstraZeneca vaccine initial results released and the “average efficacy” against COVID-19 infection is reported as a somewhat misleading 70%. “About 3,000 participants were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, and this regime appeared to provide the most protection or efficacy in the trial - around 90%. In the larger group of nearly 9,000 volunteers, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%. AstraZeneca reported these percentages and also said that its vaccine was, on average, 70% effective at preventing Covid-19 illness.” https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55086927

- WHO recommends against the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients, finding no evidence that it works. https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients

13 November 2020
- WHO changes the definition of herd immunity from “indirect protection that occurs when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection” to “a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not from exposing them to it”. https://www.aier.org/article/who-deletes-naturally-acquired-immunity-from-its-website/ 

26 April 2020
- In four U.S. state prisons, 3,277 inmates test positive for COVID-19, 96% do not have any symptoms. Officials are “very surprised” and “shocked” so many “positive” cases are “asymptomatic” (i.e. healthy). (This is not surprising considering the high cycle number used for the PCR test is likely causing false positives, and that the inmates are unlikely to have many comorbidities.) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-prisons-testing-in/in-four-u-s-state-prisons-nearly-3300-inmates-test-positive-for-coronavirus-96-without-symptoms-idUSKCN2270RX 

14 April 2020
- Dr Lawrence Broxmeyer, MD, brings attention to evidence that azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine appear to significantly reduce time to recovery in COVID-19 patients. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that also happens to be the first line of defence against fowl tuberculosis (also known as Mycobacterium avium). This is the first time in history that an antibiotic is showing effectiveness against an apparent viral disease and provides additional evidence that in China at least, some of the severe COVID-19 cases may be due to coinfection with tuberculosis or activation of latent tuberculosis. https://coronacircus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promising_Antimicrobial_Hope_for_Coronav.pdfFurther consistent with this, later, it is found in countries like the US which do not have active tuberculosis outbreaks, that azithromycin is not that effective. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00263-0/fulltext 

12 April 2020
- WHO releases a brief to deny that BCG vaccination may provide protection against COVID-19. The brief addresses only the research papers linking BCG vaccination policies and Covid prevalence (by accusing them of ignoring confounder biases), whilst ignoring the research that establishes tuberculosis as the most significant cofactor from the 28 March 2020 preprint. https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19 http://archive.fo/E3lNn 

28 March 2020
- Pre-print research released that finds an intriguing correlation between COVID-19 severity in countries and whether they have universal policies of BCG vaccination, which is used to immunise people against tuberculosis: “We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1 See also 16 March 2020 for more evidence that tuberculosis is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. 

16 March 2020
- An observational case study in Wuhan is released as a pre-print, implicating latent and active tuberculosis infection as a major risk factor for severe COVID-19. Latent tuberculosis was a more common risk factor than diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. 78% of those with severe/critical disease had active co-infections with tuberculosis. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033795v1 (Tuberculosis is common in China, with 833,000 cases in China in 2019 (compared to ~96,000 cases of COVID-19 to date as of October 2021) and this may help to explain those videos of people suddenly dropping in the streets, when no such phenomena was observed in countries where tuberculosis is not common? https://www.who.int/china/health-topics/tuberculosis)

11 March 2020
- Evidence that Dr Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Institute of Virology cannot be fully trusted. In an article published in Scientific American, Zhengli is quoted as saying that miners in a Mojang mine died from a fungus. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/ However, researchers from 20 October 2020 later find that Zhengli lied, and the miners actually died of coronavirus-like respiratory illness: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.581569/full 

6 March 2020
- Nature Medicine paper is published that states: “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9 The paper’s authors include Kristian G. Andersen and Jeremy Farrar (Wellcome Trust). Later, emails obtained from a Buzzfeed FOIA reveal that Anthony Fauci (US NIH) set up the meeting between many of the paper’s authors, so that they could plan and write the Nature Medicine paper to discourage a ‘lab origin’ for COVID-19. https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561/leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails.pdf#page=2401 Also see Chris Martenson’s podcast going through the emails in detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNxoVFZwMYw

- Prominent virologists publish a commentary in Emerging Microbes and Infections, that claims “no credible evidence” of COVID-19 being engineered by a lab. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/22221751.2020.1733440 Later, emails released by U.S. Right to Know on 11 August 2020 reveal that the editorial was submitted on 12 February, and then peer reviewed and accepted the next day (this NEVER happens in scientific publishing): https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shan-Lu-EMI-submission-Feb-12-email-OSU.pdf https://usrtk.org/biohazards/scientists-who-authored-article-denying-lab-engineering-of-sars-cov-2-privately-acknowledged-possible-lab-origin-emails-show/ One reviewer wrote, “This is a timely commentary. It is perfectly written. All four authors are well established virologists. I suggest to publish it right away.” https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EMI-acceptance-Feb-13-email-OSU.pdf Although this is not disclosed in the commentary, the emails also reveal the reviewer was Shi Zhengli, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who led gain-of-function research in bats previously (see 13 November 2017, 26 June 2016, and 9 November 2015) which is a clear conflict of interest: https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OSU-ZLS-Comments.pdf Finally, the emails also reveal that privately, the virologists who coauthored the letter admitted that “we cannot rule out the possibility that it comes from a bat virus leaked out of a lab” (https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OSU_SLL_Name-Change_Origin-to-Engineering.pdf https://usrtk.org/biohazards/scientists-who-authored-article-denying-lab-engineering-of-sars-cov-2-privately-acknowledged-possible-lab-origin-emails-show/) and they also discuss how “rumor says that furin site may be engineered”. https://usrtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OSU_Weiss_Hard-to-Imagine_SLL_Rumor.pdf 

24 February 2020

22 February 2020
- Social media begins censorship of COVID-19 “misinformation”. Only a month ago (see 27 January 2020), they started placing “Fact Checks”. Now, they have resorted to removing information they deem to be false, including a New York Post article by a Chinese scholar presenting evidence that “coronavirus may have leaked from a lab”. The article is immediately removed when people try to post it to Facebook: https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/ 

19 February 2020
- Open letter in The Lancet by 27 scientists, including Peter Daszak (President of EcoHealth Alliance) and Jeremy Farrar (Head of Wellcome Trust) who “strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.” https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30418-9/fulltext (See also, 11 September 2021, where it is later found that 26 of the 27 authors have conflicts of interest linking them to Chinese researchers or benefactors linked to Wuhan).

- In the Italian city of Padua, authorities make the decision to burn and destroy nearly 10 tons of pig meat originating from China. The meat was suspected to be infected with African swine fever and potentially fowl tuberculosis, the latter of which is likely transmissible to humans. Notably, one of the first cases of COVID-19 in Italy is found in Padua. Interestingly, fowl tuberculosis symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, cough, which are also reported in COVID-19 patients. (Later, see 16 March 2020, it is also found that tuberculosis infection is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 in Wuhan. Could this be an explanation for why Italy was hit so hard by COVID-19, when those in many other countries including neighbouring countries were experiencing only mild illness?) https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pfigshare-u-files/22204929/FINALSCIENTIAITALYINCRISISSRPRRC03000272.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=10&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b9d1d53eefc8ca9889afe64067f4d8fdf681e9dcc604c3835a615df4254baac6&X-Amz-Date=20211019T101110Z&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIYCQYOYV5JSSROOA/20211019/eu-west-1/s3/aws4_request https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Italy_in_Crisis/12077577

- EVENT 201: Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with WEF & the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsor a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201”, involving a fictional SARS pandemic meant to illustrate areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic. It is interesting to note that one of the members in attendance is George F. Gao, Director-General of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control. In October 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely spreading among humans in Wuhan, very likely with Gao’s knowledge. He stays quiet throughout the exercise.

17 October 2019
- Satellite images in Wuhan show dramatic spikes in hospital traffic around this period in October. This provides circumstantial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have already been circulating at this time. “Something was happening in October,” said Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital and director of the medical center’s Computational Epidemiology Lab. “Clearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.” https://abcnews.go.com/International/satellite-data-suggests-coronavirus-hit-china-earlier-researchers/story?id=71123270 The Harvard study that analysed this satellite data also looked at Baidu search terms in the area, and found an increase in queries relating to “cough” (potentially could also be due to seasonal influenza) as well as “diarrhea”, a COVID-19-specific symptom, providing further supporting evidence. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42669767/Satellite_Images_Baidu_COVID19_manuscript_DASH.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y PDF Archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxZFnGwZwzDC_t93tvAuzSvfbmbQctwX/view?usp=sharing

- From Science Magazine: “Last year, a U.S. government review panel quietly approved experiments proposed by two labs that were previously considered so dangerous that federal officials had imposed an unusual top-down moratorium on such research. One of the projects has already received funding from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and will start in a few weeks; the other is awaiting funding. “After a deliberative process that cost $1 million for [a consultant’s] external study and consumed countless weeks and months of time for many scientists, we are now being asked to trust a completely opaque process where the outcome is to permit the continuation of dangerous experiments,” says Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch.” https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/exclusive-controversial-experiments-make-bird-flu-more-risky-poised-resume

13 November 2017
- Dr Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr Shi Zhengli from Wuhan, publish another paper describing gain-of-function research done in coronaviruses in bats in a BSL-2 lab in Wuhan (see also: 26 June 2016). “The Wuhan Institute of Virology had continued to unearth dozens of new SARS-like coronaviruses in bat caves, and it reported making chimeras with eight of them by fusing the spikes of the new viruses to the chassis of WIV1. Two of them replicated well in human cells. They were, for all intents and purposes, brand-new pathogens.” In an email to MIT Technology Review, Shi said she followed Chinese rules that are similar to US. Since bat viruses like WIV1 haven’t been confirmed to cause disease in human beings, her biosafety committee recommended BSL-2 for engineering and testing them but BSL-3 for any animal experiments. Regarding the decision to do the research in BSL-2 conditions, Peter Daszak forwarded a statement from EcoHealth Alliance stating that the organization “must follow the local laws of the countries in which we work’ and that the NIH had determined the research was ‘not gain-of-function.’”https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/29/1027290/gain-of-function-risky-bat-virus-engineering-links-america-to-wuhan/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5708621/ 

23 October 2017
- John Hopkins Center for Health Security releases a fictional pandemic scenario called SPARS, modelled off a SARS-like virus. The scenario is aimed to teach policymakers appropriate pandemic responses. The fictional pandemic does not end up killing as many people as originally forecasted through fictional modelling. Moreover, the vaccines, which are rushed to market, have severe side effects. The pandemic ends with the President apologizing to the brave and patriotic Americans that took these experimental and harmful vaccines during a time of national crisis.

- World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility: “In an effort to fight the next pandemic faster, the World Bank has turned to global financial markets, issuing $425 million in “pandemic bonds” and related derivatives to pay for emergency relief. The World Bank’s bond sale was 200% oversubscribed, with investors eager to get their hands on the high-yield returns on offer. The majority of buyers were from Europe and included dedicated catastrophe-bond investors, pension funds, and asset managers.” Note that investors lose their money if a pandemic is declared in 2020 (very conveniently happens).

- Wuhan Institute of Virology, situated in Wuhan, becomes the first BSL-4 lab in mainland China. “BSL-4 is the highest level of biocontainment: its criteria include filtering air and treating water and waste before they leave the laboratory, and stipulating that researchers change clothes and shower before and after using lab facilities. Such labs are often controversial.” Concerns are already being raised at the lab’s opening: “But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy.” https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21487

- Dr. Anthony Fauci: "If there's one message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience... There is no question that there will be a challenge [to] the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease - and we have certainly a large burden of that - but also there will be a surprise outbreak and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you'll understand why history, and the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh3twYon8pc

- Moderna pivots towards developing mRNA vaccines as they are the fastest path to human trials: “Novartis abandoned the related realm of RNA interference over concerns about toxicity, as did Merck and Roche. Moderna said it prioritized vaccines because they presented the fastest path to human trials.” https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/13/moderna-therapeutics-biotech-mrna/ 

26 June 2016
- Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr Shi Zhengli from Wuhan, publish a paper reporting how the Chinese lab had engineered different versions of the SARS-like coronavirus named WIV1, and tested their infectiousness in human cells. The paper also included a troubling detail: the work, which was funded in part by the NIH grant, had been done in a BSL-2 lab. That meant the same viruses that Daszak was holding up as a clear and present danger to the world were being studied under conditions that, according to Richard Ebright, matched “the biosafety level of a US dentist’s office.”

12 February 2016
- A statement by Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance, was reported in the National Academies of Press Publication that highlights his interest in using the media to stir up interest in a coronavirus vaccine that would work for all coronaviruses: "We need to increase public understanding of the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics will follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process."

9 November 2015
- Paper published in Nature Medicine led by Dr. Ralph Baric (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and Dr. Shi Zhengli (Wuhan) describing gain-of-function research in coronaviruses in bats: “we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.” This research occurred during the gain-of-function ban by Congress, but apparently allowed to go ahead since it began before the ban came into effect. https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985 Commentary: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/25/opinion/coronavirus-lab.html 

17 October 2014
- In the US, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Department of Health and Human Services announce a moratorium on gain-of-function research, involving a pause to funding for experiments involving gain-of-function in viruses. “NIH has funded such studies because they help define the fundamental nature of human-pathogen interactions, enable the assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents, and inform public health and preparedness efforts,” National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said in a statement. “These studies, however, also entail biosafety and biosecurity risks, which need to be understood better.” https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/moratorium-on-gain-of-function-research-36564

- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July. Also reported that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were about as likely to be symptomatic (which is consistent with previous studies showing they had similar viral loads and transmission). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112981

- After a bus driver vaccine mandate in Chicago, many bus drivers resign, so the Mayor is looking to Uber/Lyft for help in getting kids to school. The district now has 770 drivers which is 500 drivers short. https://jalopnik.com/after-school-bus-drivers-quit-over-vaccine-mandate-chi-1847593162

31 August 2021
- Two of the FDA's most senior vaccine leaders are retiring from their positions. The apparent reason? "A former senior FDA leader told Endpoints that they‚Äôre departing because they‚Äôre frustrated that CDC and their ACIP committee are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the FDA (...) What finally did it for them was the White House getting ahead of FDA on booster shots." https://endpts.com/breaking-in-a-major-blow-to-vaccine-efforts-senior-fda-leaders-stepping-down-report/

30 August 2021
- Alex Berenson brings attention to an interesting trend whereby countries that have a large number of their population receive the first dose of a SARS-CoV2 vaccination, are associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases soon thereafter. Vietnam is used as a case study here, and this trend is similar to that seen in Israel and Britain in January. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/insanity-in-vietnam 

- Mathew Crawford also has a great writeup going into more detail in what happened in Vietnam, with statistics to back it up too. Interestingly, before mass vaccination was started, HCQ appeared to have been used quite effectively to control case numbers.  https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/vietnams-tale-of-covid-19-medicine 

29 August 2021
- 1000+ church leaders in Australia take a stance against vaccine passports by signing an letter to the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which ‚Äúpresents five objections to the introduction of vaccine passports in Australia. That is, (1) The risk of creating an unethical two-tiered society; (2) The added burden on an already burdened society; (3) Government should never coerce conscience; (4) Arbitrary implementation and questionable science; (5) The inability of churches to exclude people from worship based on their medical status.‚Äù https://caldronpool.com/over-400-church-leaders-take-a-stand-against-vaccine-passports-in-open-letter-to-prime-minister-scott-morrison/?fbclid=IwAR1OJ2MklbB1M9XUoM0x43XG_o0A5VnwzCGJ2uMLXBsW1pmyDhJFaJLFHTY

- Alex Berenson is banned from Twitter for the following Tweet, showing just how ridiculous censorship has gotten. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/goodbye-twitter 

- Mathew Crawford draws attention to the situation in Uganda, where they were able to manage the pandemic well with HCQ. Similar to what happened in Vietnam, they stopped using it due to "health concerns raised by the CDC" and started using remdesivir and vaccines instead, and the cases have just kept climbing since. But yeah, like Vietnam, Britain and Israel, this is just another weird coincidence right! https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/ugandas-tale-of-covid-19-medicine

27 August 2021
- Observational study in JAMA published, presenting data that shows increased obesity in adolescents in California during the COVID-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúThese findings, if generalizable to the US suggest an increase in pediatric obesity due to the pandemic.‚Äù Likely due to school closures and lockdowns. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783690

24 August 2021
- CDC Study Counts People Hospitalized within 14 days of recieving the Vaccine as ‚ÄúUnvaccinated‚Äù, so of you take the vaccine and end up in the hospital 2 days later with COVID-19, you are an unvaccinated person in the hospital according to this study that is being used to fearmonger!

23 August 2021
- FDA report released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge ‚Äúthe pharmacovigilance system [VAERS] that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.‚Äù FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

- Preprint research on the evolution of Delta SARS-CoV2 towards ADE. When four mutations were introduced into the RBD, this caused the virus to have immune escape to the current vaccines. At the moment, some strains already have 3 mutations in the RBD, so evolutionary escape seems inevitable at this rate.

- Efficacy of vaccines is already waning after a matter of months according to data in Israel: "New Health Ministry statistics indicated that, on average, the Pfizer shot ‚Äî the vaccine given to nearly all Israelis ‚Äî is now just 39% effective against infection, while being only 41% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID. Previously, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was well over 90% effective against infection". https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-uk-data-offer-mixed-signals-on-vaccines-potency-against-delta-strain/

30 June 2021

- Research from the Salk Institute finds that the spike protein is sufficient to cause vascular effects: ‚ÄúIn the new study, the researchers created a ‚Äúpseudovirus‚Äù that was surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model‚Äîproving that the spike protein alone was enough to cause disease.

22 March 2021
- Preprint research find that a second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccine has different effects on naive vs COVID-recovered patients. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.‚Äù https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

11 March 2021
- Getting vaccinated with Pfizer after recovering with natural immunity actually reduces immunity. This suggests that people who have natural immunity should not be further immunised through vaccination: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

10 December 2020

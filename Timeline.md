- In Australia, police are apparently trying to forcibly vaccinate Aboriginal people. A video on Twitter has surfaced showing them defending themselves from police officers using bow and arrow. https://twitter.com/ChooseLove777/status/1450119176824180739?s=20 

18 October 2021
- Colin Powell, 84, fully vaccinated, dies of COVID-19. The highest profile “rare”, “mild”, breakthrough case of COVID-19. USAToday: “Although dying from COVID-19 is extremely uncommon among the fully vaccinated, health experts say age and preexisting medical conditions may increase the odds of breakthrough infection, severe disease and even death.” Interesting that older people / those with preexisting medical conditions were originally the ones who were recommended to take the vaccine in the first place… https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/10/18/vaccine-covid-19-colin-powell-high-risk/8505663002/ 

- Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001, reports promising results from their Phase III trials. VLA2001 is a whole virus, inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine candidate that uses analogous technology to traditional vaccines. Apparently, there are less adverse events than AstraZeneca, and efficacy also appears good, with participants building immunity to S, N, and M proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is interesting that despite not taking much longer to create, all other pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna, chose to use a novel mRNA technology instead of proven traditional technologies. https://trialsitenews.com/valneva-reports-its-covid-19-vaccine-vla200-candidate-is-superior-to-astrazenecas-in-phase-3-cov-compare-trial/

- Healthy 37-year-old police officer from Western Australia suffers debilitating side effects from the first Pfizer shot, including a ruptured artery to her brain, causing a stroke. Doctor tells her it is worth the risk of having another stroke to get her second shot and be fully vaccinated. https://www.facebook.com/100014682258220/posts/1249618398870890/?d=n 

15 October 2021
- The Guardian asks people on Twitter for any stories about losing loved ones to COVID-19. This backfires, as the vast majority of replies overwhelmingly describe vaccine adverse effects. https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1448928379839864834?s=21 See 10 September for the exact same thing that happened with a different news company. 

14 October 2021
- Australian government data begins to contradict the official narrative, revealing that 36 of the 49 aged care residents that died after contracting COVID-19 during NSW's Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated. https://amp.abc.net.au/article/100539620 

13 October 2021
- Alex Berenson brings attention to Intel, one of the only companies that is using evidence-based policy regarding the COVID-19 vaccinations, including “vaccinated employees cannot say they do not want to work with unvaccinated employees. (Policy 8.4)”. Also “Intel FORBIDS managers from asking for vaccination status. (Policy 8.13)”, and “Intel ACCEPTS antibodies as a full substitute for vaccination for people who must quarantine after a Covid exposure or for travel requirements. (Policy 1.2)”. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/guess-which-fortune-50-company-wont https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/coronavirus-communication.pdf

12 October 2021
- High rate of menstrual side effects from vaccination surfaces. Pre-print research released detailing results from a survey of >39,000 women, with over half of them experiencing menstrual irregularities after COVID-19 vaccination. Notably, some groups of women who are not supposed to menstruate (those on the pill/contraceptives, women taking testosterone to transition into trans-men, women who are post-menopausal) are experiencing “breakthrough” periods at a startlingly high rate. No explanation as yet for why this is happening. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.11.21264863v1 

- Health authorities are not really acting in ways that would garner trust: Personal data collected by QR code check-ins in South Australia are being secretly stored in ‘back-up’ system and not destroyed after 28 days, as promised.

11 October 2021
- Israeli Ministry of Health finds that booster shots in Israel are not preventing infections, so they literally retroactively falsify the data to show the conclusions they want. Fortunately, some people took screenshots documenting the changes: “For example (as can be seen it in the screenshots below, released by the council), if originally on a given day there were 118 vaccinated confirmed cases vs 242 unvaccinated - it suddenly became 10 vaccinated vs. 350 unvaccinated," Koren explains. "That is, blatant changes, which our examination shows were made over months. They did not just 'round' corners - but actually drastically re-wrote the whole history.”

- Finland follows in Sweden’s footsteps, with their Institute for Health and Welfare suspending use of the Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30. https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-european-countries-are-limiting-the-use-of-modernas-covid-19-vaccine-11633610069

- Biden’s speech remarks are sounding increasingly authoritarian, blaming the unvaccinated using blatantly divisive language: “The fact is, this has been a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units. The unvaccinated patients are — are leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation and so much more because they can’t get into the ICU”. He even blames the unvaccinated for the worsening economy: “The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out.” He appears proud that people have gotten fired over their refusal to be vaccinated: “Let’s be clear: When you see headlines and reports of “mass firings” and “hundreds” of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/10/07/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-importance-of-covid-19-vaccine-requirements/ https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/q4b4bv/im_getting_super_worried_about_joe_bidens/

6 October 2021
- Sweden suspends use of Moderna vaccine for those under 30, Denmark said those under 18 won’t be offered the Moderna vaccine, and Norway urged those under 30 to get the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna. “All three countries based their decision on an unpublished study with Sweden’s Public Health Agency saying that it signals “an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium” with those under 30 at particularly higher risk. https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-denmark-public-health-health-453163d8f93618fde90c06d3474921a0 This is interesting considering that a single dose of the Moderna vaccine contains 100ug of spike protein mRNA while a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine contains only 30ug of spike protein mRNA, suggesting spike protein mRNA may have dose-dependent toxicity. https://kamal-mokeddem.medium.com/spike-protein-a-dose-dependent-killer-2e26ec28de3f Also see 29 September 2021 for a similar decision by Ontario, Canada.

- The evidence for the lab leak theory is becoming so difficult to ignore that even mainstream news is reporting that it is likely feasible. WSJ: “Four studies—including two from WHO—provide powerful evidence favoring the lab-leak theory.” https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-coronavirus-lab-leak-virology-origins-pandemic-11633462827?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/A4qRquHJjt

4 October 2021
- Waning immunity of the Pfizer vaccine has now made it into mainstream media. (I guess the difference between a conspiracy theory and fact is only 6 months 🙃) CNBC: “The effectiveness of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine against infection tumbles over several months, falling from a peak of 88% a month after receiving the two-shot series to 47% six months later.” https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/pfizer-covid-vaccine-protection-against-infection-tumbles-to-47percent-study-confirms.html

- Multiple strands of evidence of adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines have now become evident. From dose-dependent increases in cytokines/chemokines, to the high correlation between mRNA dose and fatality rate (particularly relevant as mRNA dose is higher in Moderna than Pfizer), some of the recent evidence is summarised here: https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/mechanistic-evidence-of-vaccine-induced 

3 October 2021
- Israel pushing ahead with its redefinition of “fully vaccinated” to mean 3 doses. Previously fully-vaccinated (2 dose) Israelis will now lose their vaccine passports as they have not received the third dose: “As of Thursday, some 1.6 million Israelis who are entitled to receive the third dose of the coronavirus vaccine still have not done so, meaning they will be ineligible for the new green passport.” https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/covid-vaccination-pass-israel-about-to-expire-here-s-how-to-get-a-new-one-1.10255927

- Vaccine effectiveness is dropping in the UK according to a Public Health England report recently released. A commentary on the results by The Daily Sceptic reports that: “For the 60s age group, infection rates are 63% higher in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated, up from 53% last week, giving an (unadjusted) vaccine effectiveness of minus-63%.” https://dailysceptic.org/2021/10/03/vaccine-effectiveness-hits-as-low-as-minus-66-in-the-over-40s-new-phe-data-shows

- Evidence of ADE is emerging. Project Salus analyses of data from 5.6 million Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older, indicate: “The alarming findings show that the vast majority of covid hospitalizations are occurring among fully-vaccinated individuals and that outcomes among the fully vaccinated are growing worse with each passing week.” https://www.afinalwarning.com/559002.html https://www.humetrix.com/powerpoint-vaccine.html 

- Merck has announced a new oral antiviral pill called Molnupiravir, for COVID-19 treatment.

- NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian resigns as NSW Premier as the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) announces an investigation. The investigation is not related to COVID-19, but it is interesting to note that information about how her pandemic policies have been apparently influenced by lobbyists who have been paid millions by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to drive vaccine policy is also coming to light.

- The number of deaths from all causes registered in Scotland in this week was 1,257. This is 249 or 25%, more than the five year average. Those 1,257 deaths include 135 deaths that mentioned COVID-19 - the highest weekly total since March (because vaccines work!). But even excluding those, non-Covid deaths are running more than 10% above normal. Interesting considering that 91 percent of people 16 and over in Scotland have received at least one dose and 84 percent have received two doses. https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/news/2021/deaths-involving-covid-19-week-37-13-to-19-september-2021 https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/fair-is-foul-and-foul-is-fair

19 September 2021
- Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state of 230 million people, is almost COVID-19 free despite low vaccination rates. This is due to the availability of early treatment including IVM. The use of IVM was information that was omitted in most reporting, including in the WHO’s own coverage of the situation. For the first time, a mainstream news source (Microsoft News / MSN) has finally reported on the use of IVM here.

- The number of COVID-19 cases has increased over the past few months but this is misleading, because the definition of a “case” has changed. The % of cases that are asymptomatic has been gradually increasing over the past few months. “From March 2020 through early January 2021 — before vaccination was widespread, and before the Delta variant had arrived — the proportion of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease was 36 percent. From mid-January through the end of June 2021, however, that number rose to 48 percent.” https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/covid-hospitalization-numbers-can-be-misleading/620062/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=all

Brownfield Regional Medical Center CEO Jerry Jasper: “I think the mandate is just a terrible message because if the vaccinations are working, why do you have to mandate people to get the vaccines?” Gray asked. “What happens to individual choice and medical decisions between the patient and their doctor, which is all of the things that we’re trying to support.” https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/texas-hospital-faces-closure-over-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-ceo_3998746.html

- “In the Australian corner of Twitter, the space is dominated by views that are militantly pro-lockdown, pro-COVID zero and pro-Labor premiers, and even the tamest of questions in those directions prompts an onslaught. Topics currently guaranteed to trigger a pile-on include data from official sources that highlights the minimal risks to children from COVID; reporting about the unintended costs of lockdowns including Australians stranded overseas and harm to mental health; information about how safe the AstraZeneca vaccine is” https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-14/twitter-social-media-bullies-political-journalism/100458714

- Deputy Premier of NSW revealed that vaccine passports will only be mandatory when the percentage of people vaccinated is between 70-80%. Once the 80% target is hit, vaccine passports will become optional for businesses. 80% target expected in approx 3 weeks. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9983945/Covid-19-Unvaccinated-Australians-locked-pubs-THREE-WEEKS-NSW.html 

- Data from Israel surfaces, showing that 1,400 active COVID-19 cases in partially-vaccinated 12-15 year-olds suddenly disappear after the definition of being "fully vaccinated" is changed. The new definition of "fully vaccinated" now requires 3 doses in Israel, with 2 doses considered "partially vaccinated". However, the 1,400 COVID-19 cases in those previously considered to be "partially vaccinated" (1 dose, before the definition changed) have disappeared and they have not been "moved" to the "unvaccinated" group either. This raises questions regarding the lack of data transparency and whether the data are being potentially manipulated to make it appear that COVID-19 cases in 12-15 year olds are not increasing after vaccination. https://twitter.com/connolly_s/status/1437366313689796611/photo/1  Archive: https://archive.md/JN78y 

- Nicki Minaj makes a “controversial” tweet about a potential vaccine adverse effect on her cousin’s friend’s testicles that gets her banned from Twitter. She encouraged her followers to “[…] make sure ur comfortable with your decision, not bullied”. After she is banned, she goes live on Instagram and reveals that many in Hollywood feel the same way about the vaccines and are scared to speak out. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CT3hjWVp9wa/?utm_medium=copy_link   Interestingly while the media was quick to cancel her and “fact check” her, testicular effects have been reported to VAERS, so what she is saying is not unreasonable. https://trialsitenews.com/nicki-minaj-was-right-and-all-the-worlds-covid-vaccine-experts-were-wrong/ 

- Israeli Ministry of Health caught on camera saying that "there is no medical or epidemiological justification for the Covid passport, it is only intended to pressure the unvaccinated to vaccinate". https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1437396043424059396?s=21 

- The Lancet publishes a commentary saying that “the currently available evidence does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccination in populations that have received an effective primary vaccination regimen”. The lead author on the paper is Dr Phil Krause, one of the FDA vaccine experts who resigned from the FDA on 31 August 2021 citing concerns with the booster shot approval.

- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/ 

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July. Also reported that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were about as likely to be symptomatic (which is consistent with previous studies showing they had similar viral loads and transmission). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112981

- Alex Berenson brings attention to an interesting trend whereby countries that have a large number of their population receive the first dose of a SARS-CoV2 vaccination, are associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases soon thereafter.

- 1000+ church leaders in Australia take a stance against vaccine passports by signing an letter to the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which “presents five objections to the introduction of vaccine passports in Australia.

- FDA report released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge “the pharmacovigilance system [VAERS] that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.” FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

- Vaccine rollout in Israel results in new adverse events like paresthesia and facial nerve paralysis that were not picked up in the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial. Prof. Galia Rahav, chief of the Infectious Disease Unit and Laboratories at the Sheba Medical Center: “At the beginning, they [Pfizer] said that it was just hysterical women, but it doesn’t seem that way, because we’re seeing this with men as well.” https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/295623 

6 January 2021
- Agreement between the State of Israel , the Israeli Ministry of Health, and Pfizer Inc. is released, describing how Pfizer’s vaccine will be rolled out in Israel. This agreement indicates that Israel will provide data to Pfizer about its experimental novel-technology mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, so that Pfizer can determine "whether herd immunity is achieved after reaching a certain percentage of vaccination coverage in Israel". It is not clear what benefits Israel is getting in return for this agreement. https://govextra.gov.il/media/30806/11221-moh-pfizer-collaboration-agreement-redacted.pdf Backup: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SyV0SBNDyg7259DDB3TZL99CNP2G33CG/view?usp=sharing

- Research comes out showing that using N protein as antigen rather than spike protein is likely better, since mutations don’t occur there often (whereas the spike protein is the most quickly evolving):  https://theconversation.com/covid-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-heres-another-target-150315 

- FDA emphasises importance of the placebo group referring to vaccine clinical trials: “Placebo controlled follow-up can be very important in showing that whatever happened in the vaccine group also happened in the placebo group. Because that’s our best way of knowing.”

- AstraZeneca vaccine initial results released and the “average efficacy” against COVID-19 infection is reported as a somewhat misleading 70%. “About 3,000 participants were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, and this regime appeared to provide the most protection or efficacy in the trial - around 90%. In the larger group of nearly 9,000 volunteers, who were given two full doses also four weeks apart, efficacy was 62%. AstraZeneca reported these percentages and also said that its vaccine was, on average, 70% effective at preventing Covid-19 illness.” https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55086927

- WHO changes the definition of herd immunity from “indirect protection that occurs when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection” to “a concept used for vaccination, in which a population can be protected from a certain virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not from exposing them to it”. https://www.aier.org/article/who-deletes-naturally-acquired-immunity-from-its-website/

- WHO and World Bank Group Join Forces to Strengthen Global Health Security. WHO would later declare a pandemic which meant World Bank would not return investors money in the World Pandemic Bonds (as much as 1 billion dollars). Maybe a money laundering operation to fund the Covid-19 WEF/WB/WHO agenda?

- John Hopkins Center for Health Security releases fictional pandemic scenario called SPARS aimed to teach policymakers appropriate pandemic responses. The pandemic does not end up killing as many people as originally forecasted through modelling. Moreover, the vaccines have severe side effects. The pandemic ends with the President apologizing to the brave and patriotic Americans that took these experimental and harmful vaccines during a time of national crisis.

- World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility: “In an effort to fight the next pandemic faster, the World Bank has turned to global financial markets, issuing $425 million in “pandemic bonds” and related derivatives to pay for emergency relief. The World Bank’s bond sale was 200% oversubscribed, with investors eager to get their hands on the high-yield returns on offer. The majority of buyers were from Europe and included dedicated catastrophe-bond investors, pension funds, and asset managers.” Note investors lose their money if a pandemic is declared in 2020.

- Dr. Anthony Fauci: "If there's one message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience... There is no question that there will be a challenge [to] the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease - and we have certainly a large burden of that - but also there will be a surprise outbreak and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you'll understand why history, and the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of NIAID will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh3twYon8pc

A key driver is the media, and the economics will follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process."

9 November 2015
- Paper published in Nature Medicine by Ralph Baric’s team describing gain-of-function research in coronaviruses in bats: “we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.” This research occurred during the gain-of-function ban by Congress, but apparently allowed to go ahead since it was started before the ban came into effect. https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985

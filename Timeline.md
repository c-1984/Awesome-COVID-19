- Deputy Premier of NSW revealed that vaccine passports will only be mandatory when the percentage of people vaccinated is between 70-80%. Once the 80% target is hit, vaccine passports will become optional for businesses. 80% target expected in approx 3 weeks. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9983945/Covid-19-Unvaccinated-Australians-locked-pubs-THREE-WEEKS-NSW.html

- Data from Israel surfaces, showing that 1,400 active COVID-19 cases in partially-vaccinated 12-15 year-olds suddenly disappear after the definition of being "fully vaccinated" is changed. The new definition of "fully vaccinated" now requires 3 doses in Israel, with 2 doses considered "partially vaccinated". However, the 1,400 COVID-19 cases in those previously considered to be "partially vaccinated" (1 dose, before the definition changed) have disappeared and they have not been "moved" to the "unvaccinated" group either. This raises questions regarding the lack of data transparency and whether the data are being potentially manipulated to make it appear that COVID-19 cases in 12-15 year olds are not increasing after vaccination. https://twitter.com/connolly_s/status/1437366313689796611/photo/1

- The Spectator releases a "just the statistics" article. Amongst various statistics on COVID-19 cases, vaccine adverse reactions, and flu statistics for comparison, this one stands out: “Covid has had an extremely negligible impact on the overall average number of deaths in Australia and the average age at death.” https://www.spectator.com.au/2021/09/just-the-facts-coronavirus-in-australia-by-the-numbers/?fbclid=IwAR1FQMOVjglzqQVv4vs_LnYfk5n7IdryjimXeiS_dfbMft0mi4xZlPl_BXU

- Corruption? A company part-owned by a former vice-president of the Victorian Labor Party was awarded an $86.4 million contract by the current government, to provide COVID-19 medical and health services for quarantine hotels.

1 September 2021
- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July. Also reported that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were about as likely to be symptomatic (which is consistent with previous studies showing they had similar viral loads and transmission). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112981

31 August 2021
- Two of the FDA's most senior vaccine leaders are retiring from their positions. The apparent reason? "A former senior FDA leader told Endpoints that they’re departing because they’re frustrated that CDC and their ACIP committee are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the FDA (...) What finally did it for them was the White House getting ahead of FDA on booster shots." https://endpts.com/breaking-in-a-major-blow-to-vaccine-efforts-senior-fda-leaders-stepping-down-report/ https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/top-fda-officials-quit-following-disagreement-with-bidens-rushed-covid-booster-shot-plan/

30 August 2021
- Alex Berenson brings attention to an interesting trend whereby countries that have a large number of their population receive the first dose of a SARS-CoV2 vaccination, are associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases soon thereafter. Vietnam is used as a case study here, and this trend is similar to that seen in Israel and Britain in January. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/insanity-in-vietnam 

- Mathew Crawford also has a great writeup going into more detail in what happened in Vietnam, with statistics to back it up too. Interestingly, before mass vaccination was started, HCQ appeared to have been used quite effectively to control case numbers.  https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/vietnams-tale-of-covid-19-medicine

- 1000+ church leaders in Australia take a stance against vaccine passports by signing an letter to the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which “presents five objections to the introduction of vaccine passports in Australia. That is, (1) The risk of creating an unethical two-tiered society; (2) The added burden on an already burdened society; (3) Government should never coerce conscience; (4) Arbitrary implementation and questionable science; (5) The inability of churches to exclude people from worship based on their medical status.” https://caldronpool.com/over-400-church-leaders-take-a-stand-against-vaccine-passports-in-open-letter-to-prime-minister-scott-morrison/?fbclid=IwAR1OJ2MklbB1M9XUoM0x43XG_o0A5VnwzCGJ2uMLXBsW1pmyDhJFaJLFHTY

- Mathew Crawford draws attention to the situation in Uganda, where they were able to manage the pandemic well with HCQ. Similar to what happened in Vietnam, they stopped using it due to "health concerns raised by the CDC" and started using remdesivir and vaccines instead, and the cases have just kept climbing since. But yeah, like Vietnam, Britain and Israel, this is just another weird coincidence right! https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/ugandas-tale-of-covid-19-medicine

- FDA report released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge “the pharmacovigilance system [VAERS] that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.” FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

- Preprint research on the evolution of Delta SARS-CoV2 towards ADE. When four mutations were introduced into the RBD, this caused the virus to have immune escape to the current vaccines. At the moment, some strains already have 3 mutations in the RBD, so evolutionary escape seems inevitable at this rate.

22 June 2021
- Wall Street Journal: “Public-health authorities are making a mistake and risking the public’s trust by not being forthcoming about the possibility of harm from certain vaccine side effects.” Will this start a trend of mainstream media being more open to discussion? https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/are-covid-vaccines-riskier-than-advertised-11624381749

- Craig Kelly MP suggests that prophylactic IVM has potential, in the House of Representatives in the Australian Parliament. The video was taken off YouTube for “misinformation”. However a reupload can be found here: https://rumble.com/vjbmg7-the-case-for-ivermectin-craig-kelly-mp.html

21 June 2021
- The "No Domestic COVID Vaccine Passports Bill 2021" in Australia was presented and read for the first time in the House of Representatives. The Bill proposes an Act which prohibits government/states/territories on issuing COVID vaccine passports and employers from discrimination on the basis of vaccination. https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r6724_first-reps/toc_pdf/21084b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

- SARS-CoV2 spike protein found to interact with heparin proteins, which favour aggregation of amyloidβ in brain. The S1 RBD can also bind directly to Aβ. “Heparin-binding site on the S1 might assist the binding of amyloid proteins to the viral surface and thus could leads to neurodegeneration in brain.” https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X2100499X

5 May 2021
- White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on how the Biden administration is collaborating with Big Tech to censor “misinformation”, since apparently they think the public can’t make their own decisions based on available data: “The President’s view is that the major platforms have a responsibility related to the health and safety of all Americans to stop amplifying untrustworthy content, disinformation, and misinformation, especially related to Covid19 vaccinations and elections (…) He also supports better privacy protections and a robust anti-trust program.” https://www.getrevue.co/profile/markchangizi/issues/big-tech-censorship-is-actually-government-censorship-597190

2 May 2021
- Research from the Salk Institute finds that the spike protein is sufficient to cause vascular effects: “In the new study, the researchers created a “pseudovirus” that was surrounded by SARS-CoV-2 classic crown of spike proteins, but did not contain any actual virus. Exposure to this pseudovirus resulted in damage to the lungs and arteries of an animal model—proving that the spike protein alone was enough to cause disease. Tissue samples showed inflammation in endothelial cells lining the pulmonary artery walls.” https://scitechdaily.com/covid-19-is-a-vascular-disease-coronavirus-spike-protein-attacks-vascular-system-on-a-cellular-level/

13 April 2021
- Moderna trial is unblinded and a control group of sufficient size no longer exists, “as of April 13, all placebo participants have been offered the Moderna covid-19 vaccine and 98% of those have received the vaccine.”

- Pfizer and BioNTech releases 6 month data for mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, claiming 91.3% vaccine efficacy and 100% effectiveness for preventing severe hospitalisation. https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx

23 March 2021
- Pfizer announces phase 1 trials for its new antiviral drug which will be in a pill form. The drug has showed potent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro but not yet in vivo. “Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires both prevention via vaccine and targeted treatment for those who contract the virus.” Wow. If only we already had drugs with antiviral activity and effectiveness shown through 40+ peer reviewed studies! 🤦‍♀️ https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-1-study-novel-oral-antiviral

22 March 2021
- Preprint research find that a second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccine has different effects on naive vs COVID-recovered patients. “On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.” https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

- A GP from Celbridge was suspended for refusing to administer SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to his patients. “My problem primarily is that I don’t think the pathogenicity of Covid is sufficiently severe to a. cause lockdowns or b. use a messenger RNA [vaccine],” he said as he expressed concern over the safety of the shots” https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/gp-suspended-by-medical-council-over-refusal-to-give-covid-19-vaccine-1.4516239

11 March 2021
- Getting vaccinated with Pfizer after recovering with natural immunity actually reduces immunity. This suggests that people who have natural immunity should not be further immunised through vaccination: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

9 March 2021
- AHPRA puts out a position statement to discourage registered health practitioners and students from speaking out on potential concerns regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations: "Any promotion of anti-vaccination statements or health advice which contradicts the best available scientific evidence or seeks to actively undermine the national immunisation campaign (including via social media) is not supported by National Boards and may be in breach of the codes of conduct and subject to investigation and possible regulatory action."

10 December 2020
- Research comes out showing that using N protein as antigen rather than spike protein is likely better, since mutations don’t occur there often (whereas the spike protein is the most quickly evolving):  https://theconversation.com/covid-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-heres-another-target-150315

- FDA on importance of the placebo group referring to vaccine clinical trials: “Placebo controlled follow-up can be very important in showing that whatever happened in the vaccine group also happened in the placebo group. Because that’s our best way of knowing.”

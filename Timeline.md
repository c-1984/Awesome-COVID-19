- Project Veritas Part 3 video released, showing two employees from Johnson & Johnson speaking their true thoughts about the vaccine they are helping to develop. They are refusing the J&J Janssen vaccine due to efficacy concerns and “blood clots” that are being reported “don’t get the Johnson & Johnson, I didn’t tell you though." https://youtu.be/hNIj83XNNeE 
https://t.me/project_veritas/999 

- In reviewing a case of an unfair dismissal of an employee refusing a mandated flu vaccine, Lyndell Dean, Deputy President of Fair Work Australia, stated: "Never have I more strenuously disagreed with an outcome in an unfair dismissal application", and that "all Australians should vigorously oppose the introduction of a system of medical apartheid and segregation in Australia", as "blanket rules, such as mandating vaccinations for everyone across a whole profession or industry regardless of the actual risk, fail the tests of proportionality, necessity and reasonableness."  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-27/a-fair-work-ruling-on-the-flu-jab-shows-the-divide-on-vaccin/100495596

- Pre-print research released indicating that Vitamin D3 levels are a moderate predictor (Pearson r=-0.4) of COVID-19 mortality. The authors used a systematic literature search to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates vs. D3 blood levels. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263977v1

- Natural immunity is posing a potential legal challenge to federal COVID-19 vaccination mandates. Interesting how natural immunity is considered long-lasting and robust from an evidence-based perspective, but they do not seem conducive to the political nature of “vaccine passports” and mandates, leading to the current situation: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/natural-immunity-covid-19-legality-substitute-vaccination-123106323.html

24 September 2021
- Leaked EcoHealth grant proposal details the insertion of human-specific cleavage sites to SARS-related bat coronaviruses. This provides support for the “lab leak” theory of the origins of SARS-CoV-2. https://theintercept.com/2021/09/23/coronavirus-research-grant-darpa/ Dr Chris Martenson has a great analysis/commentary of the situation here: https://odysee.com/@Chris_Martenson:2/odds-increase-that-sars-cov-2-was-lab:f 

- Thousands of hospital employees in New York will soon be fired as they have chosen not to be vaccinated with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. “In Buffalo, the Erie County Medical Center plans to suspend elective in-patient surgeries and not take intensive-care patients from other hospitals because it may soon fire about 400 employees who have chosen not to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Officials at Northwell Health, New York’s largest provider of health care, estimate that they might have to fire thousands of people who have refused to get vaccinated.” https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/nyregion/coronavirus-hospitals-vaccines.html

23 September 2021
- The number of deaths from all causes registered in Scotland in this week was 1,257. This is 249 or 25%, more than the five year average. Those 1,257 deaths include 135 deaths that mentioned COVID-19 - the highest weekly total since March (because vaccines work!). But even excluding those, non-Covid deaths are running more than 10% above normal. Interesting considering that 91 percent of people 16 and over in Scotland have received at least one dose and 84 percent have received two doses. https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/news/2021/deaths-involving-covid-19-week-37-13-to-19-september-2021 https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/fair-is-foul-and-foul-is-fair

- Project Veritas releases their first video related to the COVID-19 pandemic on vaccine adverse effects, featuring a nurse and doctor whistleblower.  Dr. Maria Gonzales, ER Doctor, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: “All this is bullshit. Now, [a patient] probably [has] myocarditis due to the [COVID] vaccine. But now, they [government] are not going to blame the vaccine.”

19 September 2021
- Pre-print research: University of Ottawa Heart Institute retrospective study finds 1 in 1,000 mRNA vaccinations is associated with myopericarditis, typically within the first few days after vaccination. This number is higher than has previously been reported (10-20 per 100,000 vaccinations as reported in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459259/) https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.13.21262182v1.full https://trialsitenews.com/university-of-ottawa-heart-institute-retrospective-study-finds-1-in-1000-mrna-vaccinations-leads-to-myopericarditis/

- Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state of 230 million people, is almost COVID-19 free despite low vaccination rates. This is due to the availability of early treatment including IVM. The use of IVM was information that was omitted in most reporting, including in the WHO’s own coverage of the situation. For the first time, a mainstream news source (Microsoft News / MSN) has finally reported on the use of IVM here.

18 September 2021
- FDA panel recommends limiting Pfizer booster shots to Americans 65 and older, and those at high risk of severe COVID-19 – not for everyone. (At least someone has some common sense in the FDA! Looks like the resignation of those two FDA vaccine experts on 31 August 2021 wasn’t for nothing.) https://news.yahoo.com/fda-panel-recommends-limiting-pfizer-213030169.html

17 September 2021
- Dr. Byram Bridle, PhD (Associate Professor of Viral Immunology from the University of Guelph) writes an open letter to the President of the University of Guelph, asking them to reconsider the motivations and evidence behind vaccine mandates.

- The number of COVID-19 cases has increased over the past few months but this is misleading, because the definition of a “case” has changed. The % of cases that are asymptomatic has been gradually increasing over the past few months. “From March 2020 through early January 2021 — before vaccination was widespread, and before the Delta variant had arrived — the proportion of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease was 36 percent. From mid-January through the end of June 2021, however, that number rose to 48 percent.” https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/covid-hospitalization-numbers-can-be-misleading/620062/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=all

- The COVID-19 pandemic is essentially over in many Indian states, including Uttarkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Goa. All those states used IVM to successfully treat COVID-19 patients. 75% of India’s cases are now coming from Kerala, one of the few states where IVM has not been used. https://www.thedesertreview.com/opinion/columnists/the-ivermectin-deworming-hoax---part-ii-eric-clapton-s-human-rights-warning/article_284902bc-14be-11ec-8d43-43e98275cff8.html

15 September 2021
- Hospital in Texas may be forced to close, due to 20-25% of healthcare workers choosing to remain unvaccinated despite the vaccine mandate. Brownfield Regional Medical Center CEO Jerry Jasper: “I think the mandate is just a terrible message because if the vaccinations are working, why do you have to mandate people to get the vaccines?” Gray asked. “What happens to individual choice and medical decisions between the patient and their doctor, which is all of the things that we’re trying to support.” https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/texas-hospital-faces-closure-over-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-ceo_3998746.html

13 September 2021
- Deputy Premier of NSW revealed that vaccine passports will only be mandatory when the percentage of people vaccinated is between 70-80%. Once the 80% target is hit, vaccine passports will become optional for businesses. 80% target expected in approx 3 weeks. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9983945/Covid-19-Unvaccinated-Australians-locked-pubs-THREE-WEEKS-NSW.html

- Data from Israel surfaces, showing that 1,400 active COVID-19 cases in partially-vaccinated 12-15 year-olds suddenly disappear after the definition of being "fully vaccinated" is changed. The new definition of "fully vaccinated" now requires 3 doses in Israel, with 2 doses considered "partially vaccinated". However, the 1,400 COVID-19 cases in those previously considered to be "partially vaccinated" (1 dose, before the definition changed) have disappeared and they have not been "moved" to the "unvaccinated" group either. This raises questions regarding the lack of data transparency and whether the data are being potentially manipulated to make it appear that COVID-19 cases in 12-15 year olds are not increasing after vaccination. https://twitter.com/connolly_s/status/1437366313689796611/photo/1 Archive: https://archive.md/JN78y

- Nicki Minaj makes a “controversial” tweet about a potential vaccine adverse effect on someone’s testicles that gets her banned from Twitter. She encouraged her followers to “[…] make sure ur comfortable with your decision, not bullied”. After she is banned, she goes live on Instagram and reveals that many in Hollywood feel the same way  about the vaccines and are scared to speak out. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CT3hjWVp9wa/?utm_medium=copy_link  Interestingly while the media was quick to cancel her and “fact check” her, testicular effects have been reported to VAERS, so what she is saying is far from unreasonable. https://trialsitenews.com/nicki-minaj-was-right-and-all-the-worlds-covid-vaccine-experts-were-wrong/

- Israeli Ministry of Health caught on camera saying that "there is no medical or epidemiological justification for the Covid passport, it is only intended to pressure the unvaccinated to vaccinate". https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1437396043424059396?s=21

- The Lancet publishes a commentary saying that “the currently available evidence does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccination in populations that have received an effective primary vaccination regimen”. The lead author on the paper is Dr Phil Krause, one of the FDA vaccine experts who resigned from the FDA on 31 August 2021 citing concerns with the booster shot approval.

- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July.

- Two of the FDA's most senior vaccine leaders are retiring from their positions. The apparent reason? "A former senior FDA leader told Endpoints that they’re departing because they’re frustrated that CDC and their ACIP committee are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the FDA (...) What finally did it for them was the White House getting ahead of FDA on booster shots." https://endpts.com/breaking-in-a-major-blow-to-vaccine-efforts-senior-fda-leaders-stepping-down-report/ https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/top-fda-officials-quit-following-disagreement-with-bidens-rushed-covid-booster-shot-plan/

- Alex Berenson brings attention to an interesting trend whereby countries that have a large number of their population receive the first dose of a SARS-CoV2 vaccination, are associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases soon thereafter. Vietnam is used as a case study here, and this trend is similar to that seen in Israel and Britain in January. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/insanity-in-vietnam 

- Mathew Crawford also has a great writeup going into more detail in what happened in Vietnam, with statistics to back it up too.

- 1000+ church leaders in Australia take a stance against vaccine passports by signing an letter to the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which “presents five objections to the introduction of vaccine passports in Australia. That is, (1) The risk of creating an unethical two-tiered society; (2) The added burden on an already burdened society; (3) Government should never coerce conscience; (4) Arbitrary implementation and questionable science; (5) The inability of churches to exclude people from worship based on their medical status.” https://caldronpool.com/over-400-church-leaders-take-a-stand-against-vaccine-passports-in-open-letter-to-prime-minister-scott-morrison/?fbclid=IwAR1OJ2MklbB1M9XUoM0x43XG_o0A5VnwzCGJ2uMLXBsW1pmyDhJFaJLFHTY

- FDA report released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge “the pharmacovigilance system [VAERS] that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.” FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

- Pfizer and BioNTech releases 6 month data for mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, claiming 91.3% vaccine efficacy and 100% effectiveness for preventing severe hospitalisation. https://investors.pfizer.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study/default.aspx

- FOIA request filed by a group of Australian doctors (Covid Medical Network) reveals that the TGA never saw or requested patient data from Pfizer and simply assumed their reporting on safety data was true. https://covidmedicalnetwork.com/open-letters/FOI-2289-relevant-documents_Redacted.pdf

- Pfizer announces phase 1 trials for its new antiviral drug which will be in a pill form. The drug has showed potent inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro but not yet in vivo. “Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires both prevention via vaccine and targeted treatment for those who contract the virus.” Wow. If only we already had drugs with antiviral activity and effectiveness shown through 40+ peer reviewed studies! 🤦‍♀️ https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-initiates-phase-1-study-novel-oral-antiviral

- Preprint research find that a second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccine has different effects on naive vs COVID-recovered patients. “On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.” https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

- A GP from Celbridge was suspended for refusing to administer SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to his patients. “My problem primarily is that I don’t think the pathogenicity of Covid is sufficiently severe to a. cause lockdowns or b. use a messenger RNA [vaccine],” he said as he expressed concern over the safety of the shots” https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/gp-suspended-by-medical-council-over-refusal-to-give-covid-19-vaccine-1.4516239

- Getting vaccinated with Pfizer after recovering with natural immunity actually reduces immunity. This suggests that people who have natural immunity should not be further immunised through vaccination: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1

9 March 2021
- AHPRA puts out a position statement to discourage registered health practitioners and students from speaking out on potential concerns regarding the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations: "Any promotion of anti-vaccination statements or health advice which contradicts the best available scientific evidence or seeks to actively undermine the national immunisation campaign (including via social media) is not supported by National Boards and may be in breach of the codes of conduct and subject to investigation and possible regulatory action."

- NPR on waning vaccine immunity due to evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: “We're not going to fall off a cliff tomorrow in terms of vaccine efficacy. What we're likely to see is a slow, steady erosion of efficacy over, perhaps, quite a long period of time.” https://www.npr.org/2021/02/09/965703047/vaccines-could-drive-the-evolution-of-more-covid-19-mutants

10 December 2020
- Research comes out showing that using N protein as antigen rather than spike protein is likely better, since mutations don’t occur there often (whereas the spike protein is the most quickly evolving):  https://theconversation.com/covid-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-heres-another-target-150315

- FDA on importance of the placebo group referring to vaccine clinical trials: “Placebo controlled follow-up can be very important in showing that whatever happened in the vaccine group also happened in the placebo group. Because that’s our best way of knowing.”

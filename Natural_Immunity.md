[Discrete immune response signature to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination versus infection (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.20.21255677v1) | Ivanova, E., Devlin, J., Buus, T., Koide, A., Cornelius, A., Samanovic, M., Herrera, A., Zhang, C., Desvignes, L., Odum, N. and Ulrich, R., 2021. Discrete immune response signature to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination versus infection. | This study uses single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare immunological responses from vaccines to natural immunity in terms of individual cell types that are involved. The authors find "our analysis revealed significant qualitative differences between the two types of immune challenges. In COVID-19 patients, immune responses were characterized by a highly augmented interferon response which was largely absent in vaccine recipients."
[Longitudinal analysis shows durable and broad immune memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection with persisting antibody responses and memory B and T cells (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255739v2) | Cohen, K.W., Linderman, S.L., Moodie, Z., Czartoski, J., Lai, L., Mantus, G., Norwood, C., Nyhoff, L.E., Edara, V.V., Floyd, K. and De Rosa, S.C., 2021. Longitudinal analysis shows durable and broad immune memory after SARS-CoV-2 infection with persisting antibody responses and memory B and T cells. _Medrxiv_. (Posted 18 June 2021) | Longitudinal follow-up of 254 COVID-19 patients who recovered with natural immunity. This paper goes into detail regarding the immune response that has been built in these individuals who now have natural immunity. Antibodies targeted against the spike protein appear to be long-lasting (at least up to 8 months, the duration of the study), and there also appears to be cross-immunity that has developed to SARS-CoV-1 and other betacoronaviruses. "n addition, spike-specific IgG+ memory B cells persist, which bodes well for a rapid antibody response upon virus re-exposure or vaccination. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are polyfunctional and maintained with an estimated half-life of 200 days." The article also makes mention of antibodies targeted to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, and how this is important because "CD8+ T cell responses preferentially target the nucleoprotein". They then go on to mention that this is a potential limitation of current vaccines, which only target the spike and do not target other proteins including the nucleoprotein. 
[Differential effects of the second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose on T cell immunity in na誰ve and COVID-19 recovered individuals (PRE-PRINT)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.22.436441v1) | Camara, C., Lozano-Ojalvo, D., Lopez-Granados, E., Paz-Artal, E., Pion, M., Correa-Rocha, R., Ortiz, A., Lopez-Hoyos, M., Iribarren, M.E., Portoles, J. and Portoles, P., 2021. Differential effects of the second SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose on T cell immunity in na誰ve and COVID-19 recovered individuals. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 22 March 2021) | This study supports that individuals with natural immunity after recovering from COVID-19 may not need any vaccine-mediated immunity: "Here we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in na誰ve and previously infected individuals during full BNT162b2 vaccination. Our results demonstrate that the second dose increases both the humoral and cellular immunity in na誰ve individuals. On the contrary, the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose results in a reduction of cellular immunity in COVID-19 recovered individuals, which suggests that a second dose, according to the current standard regimen of vaccination, may be not necessary in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2."

Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections. _medRxiv_. (Posted 25 August 2021) | A retrospective observational study in Israel finds that those who have been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine have 13-fold increased risk of a breakthrough infection as well as 27-fold risk of symptoms if they do develop a breakthrough infection, compared to those with natural immunity. The implications of this article are so astounding that it has even been covered in the mainstream media, see this [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/previous-covid-prevents-delta-infection-better-than-pfizer-shot). 
[No Significant Difference in Viral Load Between Vaccinated and Unvaccinated, Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Groups Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v1) | Acharya CB, Schrom J, Mitchell AM, Coil DA, Marquez C, Rojas S, Wang CY, Liu J, Pilarowski G, Solis L, Georgian E, Petersen M, DeRisi J, Michelmore R, Havlir D (2021) No Significant Difference in Viral Load Between Vaccinated and Unvaccinated, Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Groups Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant. _medRxiv_ 2021.09.28.21264262. (Posted 29 September 2021) | This study compared viral load (as estimated through PCR cycle threshold values) in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. "We found no significant difference in cycle threshold values between vaccinated and unvaccinated, asymptomatic and symptomatic groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta." This explains why breakthrough cases in the vaccinated are still able to contribute to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to others.

[Durability of immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.462488v1) | Suthar, M., Arunachalam, P.S., Hu, M., Reis, N., Trisal, M., Raeber, O., Chinthrajah, S., Davis-Gardner, M.E., Manning, K., Mudvari, P. and Godbole, S., 2021. Durability of immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. _bioRxiv_. (Posted 30 September 2021). | A pre-print that reveals waning immunity from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine after 6 months:<br><br>"Here, we analyzed antibody responses to the homologous Wu strain as well as several variants of concern, including the emerging Mu (B.1.621) variant, and T cell responses in a subset of these volunteers at six months (day 210 post-primary vaccination) after the second dose. **Our data demonstrate a substantial waning of antibody responses and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, at 6 months following the second immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine.** **Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit**, and suggest a 3rd booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses."<br><br>See Figure 2 for a clear demonstration of waning immunity as measured through antibody responses from CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and Tfh-like response. <br><br>Against all variants, approx. 50% of individuals had antibody levels that were undetectable. In addition, 9 of the 17 participants (53%) had a titer against the Beta variant that were below the detection limit of the assay and 47% of the participants had an undetectable neutralizing response to the delta variant. (What does it mean to be considered "vaccinated", if after 6 months, immunity may no longer be present?)<br><br>The data for the new Mu variant does not look encouraging:<br><br>"Importantly, we also measured the neutralizing response against the Mu (B.1.621) variant, first reported in Colombia earlier this year, and has recently been added to the growing list of variants of concern. Of note, the response to the Mu variant was 2.3-fold lower in comparison to the WA1 strain in day 42 sera (Fig. 3b, left panel). The magnitude of the decline was intermediate between delta and beta variants. On day 210, 53% of participants had titers below the detection limit compared to the beta variant (Fig. 3b, right panel)."<br><br>The authors conclude:<br><br>“In summary, these data demonstrate a substantial waning of antibody responses and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, at 6 months following the second immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit, and suggest a 3rd booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses”.

The purpose of the meeting was to convene to discuss the evidene for booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccines to try and address waning immunity. Various concerns are presented in this document, including safety concerns based on analysis of VAERS pharmacovigilance data. As the authors summarise:<br><br>"There is inadequate evidence for safety of booster doses amidst mounting concerns for first two doses. Significant safety concerns need to be addressed for the Covid-19 vaccines as presently used, and with the use of booster doses"<br><br>"We show intense safety signals for the Covid-19 vaccines compared with influenza vaccines with 176 times the number of deaths/person vaccinated reported in VAERS. To account for any stimulated reporting, compared with H1N1 vaccines where stimulated reporting was suspected, this ratio is still high at 35."<br><br>"Although classical disproportionality analysis is inadequate and superseded by methods that normalize for actual doses administered or people vaccinated, we nonetheless detected strong age-dependent signals for deaths, serious events like coagulopathy and myocardial infarction.  We identified three separate pools of vaccine associated deaths, totaling 45,000-147,000 deaths."<br><br>"Non C19 deaths under reported in VAERS 20,400-62,500. C19 deaths occulting in vaccinated 25,000-85,000. An unknown number of deaths in non-vaccinated contributed by transmission from vaccinated. These figures should be placed in the context of the upper estimate of 140,000 lives saved due to the vaccines (to May 2021)(1)".<br><br>"The benefits of vaccination should be considered in light of resistant strains, waning immunity(2) and development of natural immunity(3). Unresolved safety questions for pregnant mothers must be resolved. Products must be regulated as gene therapy products, with appropriate long term follow up for autoimmune diseases, cancers etc."
